      <description>2020-12-16 Fuel security and fuel stockholding costs and benefits  It is currently reviewing its refining business in the context of challenging global refining market conditions, and is considering options that include reducing its refining capacity and closing the refinery.
 Executive Summary The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is the Government’s lead adviser on national fuel security and periodically reviews fuel security policy settings. This review updates the previous reviews concentrating on national fuel supply risks and fuel security policies, particularly domestic fuel stockholding policies, under plausible market scenarios including closure of the Marsden Point oil refinery.</description>

      <description>2020-03-23 Refining NZ: Impact of conversion to fuels terminal commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:
 A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely to impact New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s supply security An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks covering at least 90 days of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s daily net import requirement; The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast) No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP; No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2; Loss of technical processing expertise; Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).</description>
