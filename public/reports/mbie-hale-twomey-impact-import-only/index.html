<p>commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:</p>
<ul>
<li>A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely
to impact New Zealand&rsquo;s supply security</li>
<li>An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks
covering at least 90 days of New Zealand&rsquo;s daily net import requirement;</li>
<li>The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that
(albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast)</li>
<li>No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification
which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions</li>
<li>Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP;</li>
<li>No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2;</li>
<li>Loss of technical processing expertise;</li>
<li>Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).</li>
</ul>
