<p>It is currently reviewing its refining
business in the context of challenging global refining market conditions, and is considering options
that include reducing its refining capacity and closing the refinery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Executive Summary
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is the Government’s lead adviser on
national fuel security and periodically reviews fuel security policy settings. This review updates the
previous reviews concentrating on national fuel supply risks and fuel security policies, particularly
domestic fuel stockholding policies, under plausible market scenarios including closure of the
Marsden Point oil refinery. The fuel importer/wholesalers were consulted as part of this review.
If the refinery closes, New Zealand is likely to see a reduction of stocks held, primarily crude and
intermediate product currently held as part of refinery operation. In total stocks could reduce to
under 70% of the previous level. New Zealand would be supplied by 100% product imports.
The analysis of the supply chain inventory changes was made more difficult by the poor quality of
MBIE’s data as a result of incorrect stocks submissions by some industry participants. This has
been a recurring problem over may years so H&amp;T recommends MBIE investigates improving the
data using the legislative powers it has to ensure this is accurate in future.
Disruption events
The analysis has found there is little change in the disruption impact for most scenarios modelled
whichever supply chain New Zealand is dependent on. This is because global disruption events
primarily impact price which will flow through to New Zealand prices whether we import crude or
product. Both supply chains are heavily dependent on imports (only about 2% of current crude
intake is produced domestically).
New Zealand is able to play its part in global oil disruption response by holding ticket stock which
can be released to the market should there be a supply disruption. This is held offshore and would
be part of a collective response to cover the disruption and keep fuel flowing to markets (in New
Zealand’s case as part of an International Energy Agency (IEA) response). Companies were
supportive of New Zealand continuing its current ticket strategy as it is very cost effective way of
complying with its commitments as a member of the IEA, and ensures New Zealand can play its
part in a global response. H&amp;T agrees with this view although has proposed an option such that
New Zealand holds a certain proportion of product ticket stocks for consideration. H&amp;T agree that
ticket stock would not assist in a domestic disruption and saw decisions around stock levels
required in New Zealand as a separate decision from compliance stocks for global response.
A hypothetical disruption to North Asian supply was modelled to assess New Zealand’s expected
increased dependence on this region with 100% product import supply. A disruption to exports
from this region could see up to 50% of New Zealand’s normal supply disrupted. For an event of
this magnitude, the market would quickly respond (prices would rise) which would see product
flowing into this region from the United States, India, Middle East and Europe. These flows occur
from time to time should there be a financial incentive and the disruption would encourage a
greater response. The gap between new supplies arriving (with longer shipping times) and the
loss of supply from North Asia was modelled with the expected inventories held under an 100%
product import case likely to provide enough buffer in the majority of cases for this transition to
happen. By comparison, such an event would be more easily managed under the current supply
system as North Asian product imports are a much smaller part of the total mix (10-15%).
There was minimal change in the impact from domestic fuel disruptions (e.g. terminal or pipeline
outages) between different supply chains as these events are infrastructure failures rather than
supply. In all cases the time to restore normal supply is (until the infrastructure is repaired)
related to the time required to put more tank trucks and drivers in place to shift the fuel longer

distances. H&amp;T found there is now greater likelihood of stock outages arising from RAP/Wiri
disruption events because of the loss of the Wynyard Wharf facility for back up supply. We have
included finding an appropriate way to respond to Auckland related disruption events as a
recommendation in this review.
In summary, while a change to 100% product import supply will dramatically reduce the amount
of stock held in New Zealand, it will not have a major impact on fuel security as:
◼ Much of the stock that will no longer be held is currently required to operate the
refinery and the related distribution system (coastal shipping) so is not immediately
available to respond to disruption events;
◼ New Zealand’s stock held on water volume will still be a similar volume and if this is
100% finished product imports provides a very flexible response measure to
disruptions; and
◼ In most domestic disruption events, the resupply constraint is set by available of tank
trucks and drivers and the different supply method has little impact.
Where the loss of refining capacity could impact New Zealand is if there was a failure in normal
global trading activity. Such an event is beyond the scope of any scenarios modelled1
. In this case
the loss of crude/ refinery intermediate stock would reduce New Zealand’s options as would the
loss of the ability to at least refine New Zealand’s domestic crude. We acknowledge that in such
circumstances other import dependences may be more critical than fuel, and as shown in the
COVID-19 response, fuel use can be dramatically reduced if necessary.
Mitigation options
The report considers three mitigation options including:
◼ Supply diversity;
◼ Arrangements for prompt supply of regional stocks; and
◼ Domestic strategic stocks and/or minimum stock obligations.
Supply diversity is a key feature of a resilient supply chain and companies noted this was
something they managed as a matter of course (i.e. diverse supply was in their commercial
interest). H&amp;T agrees that a diverse supply chain should happen in a well-functioning competitive
market and notes that any government imposed diversity requirement could increase supply costs
and possibly distort the market. We include a recommendation for monitoring of, and reporting
on, supply diversity annually.
In general, defined arrangements for prompt supply would be difficult to establish and likely to be
costly for a relatively small timing benefit. Companies have the ability to respond quickly anyway,
particularly through their parent companies or trading relationships. The cost of any arrangement
is also likely to mean funds could more usefully spent on holding stock in-country.
While stock holding decisions have been left to commercial drivers in the past (and fuel company
feedback prefers that continues), any change in supply provides MBIE the opportunity to review if
this is the best approach. MBIE should monitor stock levels on an ongoing basis, particularly
following any changes in the supply chain. Should there be concern that stock levels are trending
down over time, MBIE should consider implementing minimum stock obligations to ensure a
stocks are maintained at a reasonable level. This could be done at a level already maintained (the

Hale &amp; Twomey: Fuel Security and Fuel Stockholding Costs and Benefits 2020 Page iii
level assumed in the report) without any major impact to companies as it would not be creating
an obligation to hold more stock (just avoiding reductions). H&amp;T believes this could be
implemented to avoid impacting companies in different ways depending on their size of operation
and would not require major new infrastructure investment in an industry that is facing transition
away from fossil fuels.
Should the government decide it requires higher stocks than those that would result from the
commercially based obligation described above, it may be that stocks held separately (but in close
proximity to) industry stock would be more economic than increasing minimum stock obligations.
Such stock could be secured by:
◼ the government managing additional stocks through a ticket type structure (in line
with the current tender opportunity already offered) and funded through the current
Petroleum Fuels Levy; or
◼ an obligation managed through a stock agency that would be allow a collective
industry response as allowed in many other countries.
Additional stock should be held where it can most flexibly respond to a range of outcomes (likely
to be a large terminal like Refining NZ under 100% import product supply) although Auckland
remains the most vulnerable location for infrastructure failure which may give some incentive to
hold stock there (as recommended for jet fuel in the Auckland Fuel Supply Disruption Inquiry).
Domestic security recommendations
H&amp;T recommends that MBIE:</p>
<ol>
<li>Work to improve the stock reporting from fuel companies. While the government has the
power to enforce stock reporting2
, there are questions as to whether this legislation remains
fit for purpose and is achieving its aim. It is not obvious that there is any consequence for
providing incorrect information and a maximum $2000 fine may not be appropriate as a
deterrent. Whatever powers are used, MBIE needs to ensure there is a structure such that
fuel companies are obliged to consistently provide accurate submissions.</li>
<li>Should continue to monitor and work with the fuel industry to implement the
recommendations from the Auckland Fuel Supply Disruption Inquiry, particularly the provision
of appropriate jet storage in the Auckland region, to ensure assumptions made in this
assessment are valid once jet fuel consumption returns to previous consumption levels.</li>
<li>As also highlighted in the Auckland Fuel Supply Disruption Inquiry, the loss of Wynyard Wharf
has impacted disruption response options in Auckland, with this likely to result in greater
shortages for a RAP/Wiri disruption. MBIE should continue engaging with industry participants
on getting them to establish a replacement emergency response option to restore supply
resilience back to at least the level seen when the Wynyard Wharf terminal was operational.
Should the RNZ proposal for a moveable Skid Facility to increase supply resilience for
Auckland (and for other locations as part of an emergency response) not be acceptable, the
fuel industry should put forward other proposals to mitigate the loss of Wynyard Wharf.</li>
