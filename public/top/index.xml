      <description>Our Kaupapa The Marsden Point Refinery is New Zealand Industrial Taonga. In summary, we beleive that:
We should preserve it for our future economic resilience as we smoothly and safely modenrize our energy sources.
 Marsden Point is critcal for Neww Zealand economic resilience in a world of geopolitical shocks and global supply-chain breakdown. The decision to decomission Marsden Point was driven by 2 parties who do not have the econmic intererst of New Zealanders at heart:  a small ideoligcal faction in government on pursuit of political power the very short term finaical interests of the shareholders   The government can easily afford to buy an infulential or controlling stake the Refinery to facilitate a longer planning horizon.</description>
