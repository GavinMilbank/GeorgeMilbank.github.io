<p>The Energy Minister said these risks are not significant, but a consultant&rsquo;s report to the government says the opposite.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Security and resilience were now the two most important factors for the economy. The closure of the refinery was corporate self-interest and not in the wider interests of New Zealand. It was disturbing that the lessons from Covid and the flow on disruption to our supply chains were being ignored.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) said that &ldquo;would mark a significant change in New Zealand&rsquo;s fuel supply chain&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>But its advice was that the supply chain was secure because the country could get fuel from multiple locations overseas.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>It was &ldquo;very unlikely&rdquo; the country would ever be cut off entirely, and if it were, this would cut shipping of crude oil, too, the ministry told RNZ.</p>

<p>This was New Zealand’s only refinery. It seems an unnecessarily risky move from the Government to let it close without exploring other options</p>

<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cabinet paper said a loan or similar underwriting facility could support Refining NZ through “the current period of low earnings”, which Woods expected to persist for two to three years, with the reasonable prospect of repayment if or when refining earnings returned to adequate levels.
But it is understood Woods’ idea for those negotiations was not ultimately endorsed by fellow ministers.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The Maritime Union of New Zealand&rsquo;s national secretary Craig Harrison was sceptical of the fuel security assurances Refining NZ, and Z Energy, had given. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made a lot of assumptions, which basically is the line of what they want on their balance sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The company and its big oil company shareholders say it&rsquo;s no longer economic to run a refinery in New Zealand. The timing is unfortunate. There have been a few periods in the almost 60 years since then Prime Minister Keith Holyoake opened the refinery in May 1964 when New Zealand has been grateful for the security of fuel supply that a domestic producer provides – like when the 1973 Arab–Israeli War sparked the first oil shock, for example.  This week’s invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the world’s second largest oil producer, looks like being another critical time for international oil and fuel supplies.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Refinery worker Aaron Holrowd, who is First Union’s delegate at the site, said coming to the end of the refining business was very disappointing. “We&rsquo;re coming to the end when the business would be the most profitable manufacturer in the country, as refining margins are huge.”</p>
