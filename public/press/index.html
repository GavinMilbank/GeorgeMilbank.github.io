<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Security and resilience were now the two most important factors for the economy. The closure of the refinery was corporate self-interest and not in the wider interests of New Zealand. It was disturbing that the lessons from Covid and the flow on disruption to our supply chains were being ignored.</p>

<li>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) said that &ldquo;would mark a significant change in New Zealand&rsquo;s fuel supply chain&rdquo;.</li>
<li>But its advice was that the supply chain was secure because the country could get fuel from multiple locations overseas.</li>
