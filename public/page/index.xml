      <description>The March 2020 Hale and Twomey report commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:
 A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely to impact New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s supply security An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks covering at least 90 days of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s daily net import requirement; The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast) No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP; No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2; Loss of technical processing expertise; Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).</description>

      <description>Refinery/
 Jun 2021 - Marsden Point closure could expose NZ to fuel security risks    The Energy Minister said these risks are not significant, but a consultant&amp;rsquo;s report to the government says the opposite.
    Aug 2021 - Marsden Point refinery closure threatens energy security, Maritime Union says    Security and resilience were now the two most important factors for the economy. The closure of the refinery was corporate self-interest and not in the wider interests of New Zealand.</description>
