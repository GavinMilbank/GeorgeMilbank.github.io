<p>Options of saving the refinery touch on a debate about the role of government in society and the economy.
A government role may be useful in ensuring certain basic public services are provided in all circumstances.</p>

<p>Refinery worker Aaron Holrowd, who is First Union’s delegate at the site, said coming to the end of the refining business was very disappointing. “We&rsquo;re coming to the end when the business would be the most profitable manufacturer in the country, as refining margins are huge.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Cabinet paper said a loan or similar underwriting facility could support Refining NZ through “the current period of low earnings”, which Woods expected to persist for two to three years, with the reasonable prospect of repayment if or when refining earnings returned to adequate levels.
But it is understood Woods’ idea for those negotiations was not ultimately endorsed by fellow ministers.</p>

<h2 id="business-identities">Business Identities</h2>
<p>The document will introduce some key management identities involved in the business restructure of RNZ and its evolution into ‘Channel Infrastructure NZ’ as of 1 April 2022 who will continue to operate at the Marsden Point site. Their introduction is necessary as both were involved in the review conducted by RNZ during mid 2020 as to the refinery’s future. They are shown below along with a shortened employment record. (A more complete CV of them is available which shows that both have significant experience in energy industry sector closure, decommissioning or in failure at management roles.)</p>
<p>Quote below from Paul Zealand Managing Director Refining NZ 04/02/2020.
Managing Director, Paul Zealand described the role - the first ever for Refining NZ– as a critical addition to the management team.
“As Chief Operating Officer Andrew will have responsibility for all onsite execution and improvement activities at Marsden Point. He will report to me as the acting CEO during the transition to the new CEO Naomi James, who is due to take up the role in April.”</p>
<p>Andrew Brewer:- Ampol Australia and Canada (aka Caltex Chevron) 12 years until March 2020 Various Senior Management roles including GM at Kurnell Refinery prior to its decommission and removal in 2014.

<blockquote>
<p>Over FY21, Z has supported the strategic
review of Refining NZ’s operations.
This review has made it clear that
Refining NZ’s future is as a fuel import
terminal rather than a sub-scale refiner
of crude oil.
Shifting to a fuel import terminal will
remove Z’s exposure to refining margins
and reduce the volatility of earnings
and operating expenses.
Over FY21, climate change has
emerged as a highly material issue for
Z’s stakeholders. We’re not surprised.
The Government has declared a climate
emergency, the effects of a warming
climate continue to be felt and, at the time
of publication, there is ongoing private
legal action taken by an individual against
Z and a number of other companies
around the impacts of climate change.</p>

<p>Value of keeping the refinery:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cost is basically volatility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ther Fuel Cartle ownership model - they were not incentivieed to run the refinery at a profit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For global multinationals the push is to globalise but they <em>should never have had contorl of the reinfery</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The multinational don&rsquo;t care about New Zealand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The orginal sin was handing control over - it was very naive and relied on the</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Government</p>
<ul>
<li>Loan</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Tax
<ul>
<li>Tariff on Imported Refined</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Private</p>
<ul>
<li>A Patriotic Consortium</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The government seems the best vehicle.</p>
<p>One way to save the refinery would be to tariff imported refined products.</p>
