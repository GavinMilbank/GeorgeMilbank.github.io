<main>
<p>Despite government claims to the contrary, closure of Marsden Point has <em>clearly decreased New Zealand&rsquo;s fuel security</em>
because we have simply removed an option for supply, Where we previously may have imported direclty, imported crude or with modification
process our own crude, now we are restricted to import only. The downside risks of no fuel scenarios
would seems to have significantly increased. The government has probably overly foucsed on the benign recent geopolitical environemnt and
given too much emphasis to the climate change policies.</p>
<p>We collect some artile which examins the type of dirvers ot the downside tail possibilities.</p>
<p>The New Zealand government has regularly reviewed the fuel secuirty situation.</p>

<p>Security and resilience were now the two most important factors for the economy. The closure of the refinery was corporate self-interest and not in the wider interests of New Zealand. It was disturbing that the lessons from Covid and the flow on disruption to our supply chains were being ignored <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/126002293/marsden-point-refinery-closure-threatens-energy-security-maritime-union-says">Aug 2021 - Marsden Point refinery closure threatens energy security, Maritime Union says</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) said that &ldquo;would mark a significant change in New Zealand&rsquo;s fuel supply chain&rdquo;.
But its advice was that the supply chain was secure because the country could get fuel from multiple locations overseas.
It was &ldquo;very unlikely&rdquo; the country would ever be cut off entirely, and if it were, this would cut shipping of crude oil, too, the ministry told RNZ.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Maritime Union of New Zealand&rsquo;s national secretary Craig Harrison was sceptical of the fuel security assurances Refining NZ, and Z Energy, had given. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made a lot of assumptions, which basically is the line of what they want on their balance sheet.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The company and its big oil company shareholders say it&rsquo;s no longer economic to run a refinery in New Zealand. The timing is unfortunate. There have been a few periods in the almost 60 years since then Prime Minister Keith Holyoake opened the refinery in May 1964 when New Zealand has been grateful for the security of fuel supply that a domestic producer provides – like when the 1973 Arab–Israeli War sparked the first oil shock, for example.  This week’s invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the world’s second largest oil producer, looks like being another critical time for international oil and fuel supplies.</p>
