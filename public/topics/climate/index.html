<p>We disagree with the premise of the great urgency of a move away from fossil fuels although an increasing
depedence on alternatives is probably inevitable and desirable. One reason the NZ government let the
refinery close was to meet climate emissions targets expressed through the ETS.
The likelihood of the harmful man-made CO<sub>2</sub> driven gobal warming apppears low and the
mitigation technique appear to be ineffectual on climate and costly to our civilisation.</p>
<p>We have more faith in the climate change skeptics than the alarmists.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-the-science-behind-climate-change">State of the Science Behind Climate Change</h2>
<p>We broadly believe that climate is a complex system which is exceeding difficult to forecast because
of the non-linearities. The main issue being the the predominant greenhouse gas, H<sub>2</sub>0 is
around its triple point. Phase changes and large time scales then the fact that we have no control
of the largest forcing function - the sun.</p>

<p>William Happer examines the transmission of infrared radiation through a cloud-free atmosphere from
the Earth’s surface to outer space down the radiative properties of the problem in the paper
<a href="./happer-greenhouse-gases.pdf">Dependence of Earth’s Thermal Radiation on Five Most Abundant Greenhouse Gases</a>
which concludes that at current concentrations, the forcings from all greenhouse gases are saturated.</p>
<p>The earth also has a natural negative feedback against a pertubation of more heat (blackbody radiation at T<sup>4&lt;/sup]&gt;).
The models need a positive feedback loop of water vapour to create their frightening warming scenarios.
These tipping point usually involve pahses changes of water (or CO_2 methane)
This is not likely and</p>

<p>THe argument laid out in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">Climate Change Wikipedia artcile</a></p>
<p>The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation), decades or even centuries.[54] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is &ldquo;external&rdquo; to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.[55] Examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth&rsquo;s orbit around the.</p>
<p>Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing (so warming not due to the sun).
Everyone accepts the geeehouse effect.
Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.[59]</p>
<p>Global warming became the most popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate
Before the 1980s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling.</p>
<p>We can easily test how easy it is to sruvie in 1000 ppm C0<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The ETS scheme attempts to price the purported climate damage casued by greenhouse gases but there are many falws to this system.</p>
<p>We do however believe in the sense of some amount of elasticity in nature, so we think it is important to keep a balance of biomass. In fact plants seem to be thriving with a slight increase in C0_<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p>
<h2 id="skeptics-vs-alarmists">Skeptics vs Alarmists</h2>
<p><em>Average ground temperature</em> is impossible to measure since most of the Earth is ocaen.
The measured attitude and skeptical attitudes of thess scientists really resonate with us:
An appeal to authority argument is more useful than imagined, but it does give you soe idea on the quality of the respective arguemtns.</p>

<p>Freeman Dyson is one of the smartest mathematicaians and scientists of the great era of physics.
He later did work on some of the earlier climate models before it became fashionable (lucrative) and political.</p>
<p>He explains his view in this <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/freeman_dyson_takes_on_the_climate_establishment">excellent interview</a></p>
<blockquote>

<li>Five reservoirs of carbon all are in close contact — the atmosphere, the upper level of the ocean, the land vegetation, the topsoil, and the fossil fuels. They are all about equal in size. They all interact with each other strongly. So you can’t understand any of them unless you understand all of them</li>
<li>Syukuro Manabe, right here in Princeton, was the first person who did climate models with enhanced carbon dioxide and they were excellent models. And he used to say very firmly that these models are very good tools for understanding climate, but they are not good tools for predicting climate</li>
<li>But I have seen that happen in many fields. You sit in front of a computer screen for 10 years and you start to think of your model as being real.
It is also true that the whole livelihood of all these people depends on people being scared.</li>
<li>Yes. And I feel very strongly that China and India getting rich is the most important thing that’s going on in the world at present.
It would be a shame if we persuade them to stop that just for the sake of a problem that’s not that serious. Luckily they are, in fact, pretty self-confident; (neither) of those countries pays too much attention to us.</li>
