      <description>After a period of consultation Megan Woods signed the deth notice of the refinery with the release of the cabinet paper MBIE Cabinet Paper - Fuel supply resilience without a domestic oil refinery.
Subject to a final decision by Refining NZ, due by 30 September 2021, oil refining operations are expected to cease between March and June 2022, after which 100 per cent of refined fuels will be imported. I propose to progress development of options to ensure domestic fuel stock levels remain adequate, as a means of supporting fuel supply resilience, as New Zealand transitions away from fossil fuels.</description>
