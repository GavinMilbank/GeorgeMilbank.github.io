      <description>Despite government claims to the contrary, closure of Marsden Point has clearly decreased New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s fuel security because we have simply removed an option for supply, Where we previously may have imported direclty, imported crude or with modification process our own crude, now we are restricted to import only. The downside risks of no fuel scenarios would seems to have significantly increased. The government has probably overly foucsed on the benign recent geopolitical environemnt and given too much emphasis to the climate change policies.</description>

Because of our distaince it&amp;rsquo;s better to get oiland gas locally.
The release of the MBIE document advising against a future for refining (as they had done for oil and gas exploration and production) came just before the Covid demand shock and after a long period of profit extraction by the shareholders and low refining margins because of excess capacity oversaes.</description>
