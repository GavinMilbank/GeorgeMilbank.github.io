 But most of this is expected to be met by the Marsden Point oil refinery closure, which will reduce the countryâ€™s emissions by about 2.5 Mt in the first emissions budget period to 2025. That means the country will only have to reduce its projected emissions from other sources by an average of 0.6 Mt during this period.
 The First Union said last month that, if the Marsden Point refinery did close, the net result would be a net rise in global carbon emissions.</description>

Because of our distaince it&amp;rsquo;s better to get oiland gas locally.
The release of the MBIE document advising against a future for refining (as they had done for oil and gas exploration and production) came just before the Covid demand shock and after a long period of profit extraction by the shareholders and low refining margins because of excess capacity oversaes.</description>

      <description>We disagree with the premise of the great urgency of a move away from fossil fuels although an increasing depedence on alternatives is probably inevitable and desirable. One reason the NZ government let the refinery close was to meet climate emissions targets expressed through the ETS. The likelihood of the harmful man-made CO2 driven gobal warming apppears low and the mitigation technique appear to be ineffectual on climate and costly to our civilisation.</description>
