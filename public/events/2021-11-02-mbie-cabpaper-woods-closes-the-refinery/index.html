<p><a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/17733-fuel-supply-resilience-without-a-domestic-oil-refinery-proactiverelease-pdf">MBIE Cabinet Paper - Fuel supply resilience without a domestic oil refinery</a>
I propose to progress development of options to ensure
domestic fuel stock levels remain adequate, as a means of supporting fuel supply resilience,
as New Zealand transitions away from fossil fuels.</p>
<p><code>implications for meeting the Government’s first emissions reduction budget.</code></p>
<p>The Minister of Energy and Resources recommends that the Committee:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Note that Refining NZ plans to convert its Marsden Point oil refinery to a fuel import terminal and
expects to make a final decision by 30 September 2021.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that closure of the refinery is expected to have little impact on fuel supply resilience under
most disruption scenarios, but it could reduce New Zealand’s resilience to a low likelihood but
high consequence event that leaves New Zealand with no ability to import fuels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that options to mitigate any reduction in fuel resilience include increasing minimum levels
of fuel stock held in New Zealand and/or subsidising Refining NZ to maintain refinery operations
for a limited period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that there is not a strong case on the basis of fuel security to maintain refinery operations
but there are broader considerations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree to investigate the option of increasing minimum levels of fuel stock held in New Zealand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite the Minister of Energy and Resources to report back to Cabinet by 20 December 2021 for
approval to release a consultation paper on minimum fuel stockholding obligations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>There does not appear to be a clear case for maintaining refinery operations for fuel resilience reasons, except to address an exceptional ‘no fuel imports’ scenario. This is an unlikely scenario, but not entirely implausible, therefore I believe the option of maintaining refinery capacity warrants an active decision by Government.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I have considered an option to support Refining NZ to ensure the refinery continues operating
for a period of time – perhaps five or 10 years – by limiting its exposure to volatile earnings.
The Government could provide a loan or similar underwrite facility to support Refining NZ
through the current period of low earnings (expected to persist for two to three years), with
reasonable prospect of repayment if or when refining earnings return to adequate levels.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I do not believe there is a strong case to support continued refinery operations on fuel security grounds but I acknowledge there are broader considerations. I am therefore open to
commencing discussions with Refining NZ on that option, should Cabinet invite me to do so,
subject to availability of budget for a negotiating team with the necessary commercial and
legal capability (up to $1 million).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>I also consider the other adverse impacts of the planned closure are manageable and do not warrant measures that would, among other things, make it harder for us to meet the first emissions reduction budget</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>However, while the likelihood of a major fuel import disruption is small in the next 10-15 years, I acknowledge the consequences of such an event would be serious and this risk warrants
careful consideration. On this basis, I am open to alternative views on the merits of
commencing discussions with Refining NZ on options to ensure continued operation for five to
10 years.</p>
