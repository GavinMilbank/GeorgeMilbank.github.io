<ul>
<li>Highly skilled jobs and manufacturing capability
- RNZ currently employs around 400 people directly, a similar number indirectly
- Less demand for the current New Zealand coastal shipping fleet
- RNZ contributes about $10 million to the largely fixed cost of supplying electricity, water and other utilities
- RNZ employs about 120 skilled engineers with specialist expertise in energy whose skills may not have alternate sources of employment in New Zealand.
- Mothballing would need several years to re-start. Demolition and site rremeidation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
<ul>
<li>Transition to future domestic hydrogen and liquid biofuels industries</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As MBIE pushed ahead with apthe decision not to act to preven the Marsden Point Refinery closure, they commissioined the report <a href="https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/15260-refining-nz-impact-of-conversion-to-fuels-terminal">Refining NZ: Impact of conversion to fuels terminal</a>.</p>
<p>commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely
to impact New Zealand&rsquo;s supply security</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks
covering at least 90 days of New Zealand&rsquo;s daily net import requirement;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that
(albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification
which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of technical processing expertise;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).</p>
</li>
