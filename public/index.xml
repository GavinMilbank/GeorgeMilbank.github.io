      <title>Refinery Closure to Underpin Emissions Budget</title>

      <description>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/466970/nz-s-first-three-emissions-budgets-guaranteed-with-non-partisan-support-minister
But most of this is expected to be met by the Marsden Point oil refinery closure, which will reduce the country’s emissions by about 2.5 Mt in the first emissions budget period to 2025. That means the country will only have to reduce its projected emissions from other sources by an average of 0.6 Mt during this period.
The First Union said last month that, if the Marsden Point refinery did close, the net result would be a net rise in global carbon emissions.</description>

Thie year would have been the most profitable RNZ also owns and operates the Refinery-Auckland Pipeline (RAP).

      <description>Options of saving the refinery touch on a debate about the role of government in society and the economy. A government role may be useful in ensuring certain basic public services are provided in all circumstances.

      <description>Losing the refinery is another step on the path to a loss of national economic sovreignty. As the world engages in re-shoring of supply chains and a rollback of naive globablism we should retain some form of ownership of the refinery to give us economic optionality and value. In particular the transfer of national assets to unrestricted private ownership where very often is foreign with no allegiance to the New Zealand people.</description>

      <description>The refinery is a major contributor to New Zealands economy in many ways and its economic benefits are not easily or qucikly substitued.
Value of keeping the refinery:
Cost is basically volatility. Ther Fuel Cartle ownership model - they were not incentivieed to run the refinery at a profit.

      <description>After a period of consultation Megan Woods signed the deth notice of the refinery with the release of the cabinet paper MBIE Cabinet Paper - Fuel supply resilience without a domestic oil refinery.
Subject to a final decision by Refining NZ, due by 30 September 2021, oil refining operations are expected to cease between March and June 2022, after which 100 per cent of refined fuels will be imported. I propose to progress development of options to ensure domestic fuel stock levels remain adequate, as a means of supporting fuel supply resilience, as New Zealand transitions away from fossil fuels.</description>

      <description>Despite government claims to the contrary, closure of Marsden Point has clearly decreased New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s fuel security because we have simply removed an option for supply, Where we previously may have imported direclty, imported crude or with modification process our own crude, now we are restricted to import only. The downside risks of no fuel scenarios would seems to have significantly increased. The government has probably overly foucsed on the benign recent geopolitical environemnt and given too much emphasis to the climate change policies.</description>

Because of our distaince it&amp;rsquo;s better to get oiland gas locally.
The release of the MBIE document advising against a future for refining (as they had done for oil and gas exploration and production) came just before the Covid demand shock and after a long period of profit extraction by the shareholders and low refining margins because of excess capacity oversaes.</description>

The company’s poor governance structure has contributed to its current problems.
The board is dominated by oil company executives who are constantly changing. For example Refining NZ has had 44 different directors over the past decade.
In addition the refinery’s chief executive or general manager has often been seconded from one of the major oil companies.
These oil companies, which have a combined 72.</description>

      <description>Brian Gaynor reports in 2014 that:
Refining NZ listed on the NZX in September 1962, received its first tanker of Kuwait feedstock in February 1964 and was officially opened by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake three months later. Refinery margins were government controlled. The original refinery was built as a simple hydroskimming refinery, which is a crude distiller unit with limited secondary upgrading. Prime Minister Robert Muldoon included the expansion of the Marsden Point refinery as one of his “Think Big” projects in the early 1980s.</description>

      <description>We disagree with the premise of the great urgency of a move away from fossil fuels although an increasing depedence on alternatives is probably inevitable and desirable. One reason the NZ government let the refinery close was to meet climate emissions targets expressed through the ETS. Observed temperature change and well whithin the bounds of natural variation from the historical recrod when man was not influencing the composition of the atmospehre in any way.</description>

      <description>Letter By Dave
Introduction This document intends to outline the New Zealand Labour governments’ complicity in the decommissioning of the refinery owned and operated by Refining NZ (RNZ) located at Marsden Point from being a crude oil refinery into a finished fuel product import only terminal. Additionally it will highlight various events, actions or responses that have occurred over the timeline of early 2020 up until events of the last few days.</description>

      <description>The government could yet intervene as has for other critical public goods such as Kiwirail, Air New Zealand and Tiwai Point and Ihumatao Government intervention was discuseed in a Megan Woods cabinet paper, but willfully ignored. We could encourage different ownership structures nwith the type of planning horizon necessary for such a crucial asset. https://carbon-pulse.com/category/new-zealand/
