      <description>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/466970/nz-s-first-three-emissions-budgets-guaranteed-with-non-partisan-support-minister
 But most of this is expected to be met by the Marsden Point oil refinery closure, which will reduce the country’s emissions by about 2.5 Mt in the first emissions budget period to 2025. That means the country will only have to reduce its projected emissions from other sources by an average of 0.6 Mt during this period.
 The First Union said last month that, if the Marsden Point refinery did close, the net result would be a net rise in global carbon emissions.</description>

      <description>2020-03-23 Refining NZ: Impact of conversion to fuels terminal commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:
 A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely to impact New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s supply security An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks covering at least 90 days of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s daily net import requirement; The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast) No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP; No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2; Loss of technical processing expertise; Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).</description>

      <description>Addressing New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s oil Security in 2040  How might changes in the geopolitical environment affect the efficacy of New Zealand’s current oil security assessments and policies out to 2040? Through document analysis and utilising a scenario-based approach, this research has found that New Zealand’s current oil security assessments and corresponding policy recommendations do not adequately address geopolitical uncertainty.
 With the identified limitations of current assessments in mind, this study has identified a number of ways that New Zealand’s oil security assessments could be improved.</description>

   The company’s poor governance structure has contributed to its current problems.
    The board is dominated by oil company executives who are constantly changing. For example Refining NZ has had 44 different directors over the past decade.
    In addition the refinery’s chief executive or general manager has often been seconded from one of the major oil companies.</description>

      <description>Refining NZ listed on the NZX in September 1962, received its first tanker of Kuwait feedstock in February 1964 and was officially opened by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake three months later. Refinery margins were government controlled. The original refinery was built as a simple hydroskimming refinery, which is a crude distiller unit with limited secondary upgrading. Prime Minister Robert Muldoon included the expansion of the Marsden Point refinery as one of his “Think Big” projects in the early 1980s.</description>
