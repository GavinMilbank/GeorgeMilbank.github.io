<p><a href="https://milfordasset.com/insights/refining-shareholder-faces-unequal-battle">Brian Gaynor reports in 2014</a> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refining NZ listed on the NZX in September 1962, received its first tanker of Kuwait feedstock in February 1964 and was officially opened by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake three months later. Refinery margins were government controlled.</li>
<li>The original refinery was built as a simple hydroskimming refinery, which is a crude distiller unit with limited secondary upgrading.</li>
<li>Prime Minister Robert Muldoon included the expansion of the Marsden Point refinery as one of his “Think Big” projects in the early 1980s. This expansion was based around a hydrocracker, which produces much higher value products than the hydroskimming process at a cost of $2 billion.</li>
<li>As part of the deregulation of the refining sector in 1988 Refining NZ was “gifted” the hydrocracker expansion and given an additional $85 million cash grant.</li>
<li><em>In other words Refining NZ was given a brand new hydrocracker, which had cost $2 billion, while the borrowings associated with this expansion remained with taxpayers.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>-&gt; Refining NZ posted a loss of more than half a billion dollars as it wrote down the value of the Marsden Point refinery ahead of its conversion to a fuel import only terminal.</p>
