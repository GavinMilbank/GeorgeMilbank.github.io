<p>Marsden Point Refinery is a critical piece of infrastructure which until recently provided most of
<a href="">NZ&rsquo;s transport fuel</a>, roading <a href="">bitumen</a> as well as <a href="">CO<sub>2</sub></a> for food processing and
<a href="">sulphur</a> for fertlizer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. And is slated for destruction by corrupt <a href="">Fuel Retailing Cartel</a>
enabled by naive and incompetent <a href="">Government Green Ideologues</a>, as the country moves to an <a href="">import only model</a> which
exposes NZ to <a href="">supply, price and quality risks</a>, exports all the <a href="">GDP associated with the refinery</a> and
removes <a href="">options for energy development</a>.</p>
<p>In 1988 Refining NZ got a $2 billon refinery paid for by the taxpayer. The main shareholders, the fuel retailing cartel
sucked profits out of the refinery and into their downstream businesses over many years using their controversial (70/30) fee structure.
Even given the existence of much more efficient mega-refineries principally in Asia,
there is obviously increased supply chain risk in having these as the only source of refined products. The government appears to have been influenced
by emissions reduction goals not to offer to help the refinery through the diffcult times of the Covid pandemic.
The almost comic incompetence of the decision to close the refinery was immediately showcased with the refining business surging to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjNqvObCfKc">historic profitability</a> as supply chain and geopolitical risks skyrocket.</p>

<p>The refinery is currently in the state of a regular shutdown but can still be saved is we <a href="https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz/">act quickly</a> as the government has done for <a href="">Air NZ</a>, <a href="">Tiwai Point</a> <a href="">Ihumatao</a>. In fact a <a href="">cabinet paper Megan Woods propesed a loan to save the refinery</a> which was rejected by cabinet. A motive for this economic sabotage became clear when <a href="">James Shaw</a> announced his <a href="https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/emissions-budgets-and-the-emissions-reduction-plan/">emissions budgets</a> noting in a <a href="https://environment.govt.nz/assets/publications/REDACTED-Emissions-Budgets-for-2022-2025_2026-2030-and-2031-2035-cabinet.pdf">cabinet paper</a> the accounting trick of
exporting our refinery emissions (along with some GDP) while probably actually increasing global emissions.</p>

<p>With the closure of Marsden Point Refinery we have clearly increased our fuel supply chain risk becasue we have added extra external supply chain steps. If we can process our own crude, then we eliminate most external risks. We can&rsquo;t let these clowns and villains wreck our country buy selling off and gas-axing this unique industrial taonga which our parents and grandparents paid for. You stope them by joining groups such as the <a href="https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz">Dig-In at Marsden Point</a> to fight back against this insanity.</p>
