<p>Marsden Point Refinery is a critical piece of infrastructure which until recently provided most of NZ&rsquo;s
<a href="">transport fuel</a>, roading <a href="">bitumen</a> as well as <a href="">CO<sub>2</sub></a> for food processing and
<a href="">sulphur</a> for fertlizer<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It is slated for destruction by the <a href="">Fuel Retailing Cartel</a>
enabled by <a href="">Government Green Ideologues</a>, as the country moves to an <a href="">import only model</a> which
exposes NZ to <a href="">supply, price and quality risks</a>, exports all the <a href="">GDP associated with the refinery</a> and
removes <a href="">options for energy development</a>.</p>
<p>In 1988 Refining NZ got a $2 billon refinery paid for by the taxpayer. The main shareholders, the fuel retailing cartel
sucked profits out of the refinery and into their downstream businesses over many years by giving themselves a 30% discount on the refinery product.
Even given the need to compete with more efficient mega-refineries principally in Asia,
there is obviously increased supply chain risk in having these as the only source of refined products, so great insurance and optionality value
in having a local refinery. The government appears to have been influenced
by emissions reduction goals not to offer to help the refinery even over the Covid downturn.
The almost comic incompetence of the decision to close the refinery was immediately showcased with the refining business surging to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjNqvObCfKc">historic profitability</a> as supply chain and geopolitical risks skyrocket.</p>

<p>Because of the refinery&rsquo;s obvious importance a cabinet paper by Megan Woods did float the idea of
<a href="">a loan to save the refinery</a> as has been done in Australia, but this was rejected by cabinet.
A motive for this economic sabotage became clear when <a href="">James Shaw</a> announced his <a href="https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/emissions-budgets-and-the-emissions-reduction-plan/">emissions budgets</a> noting in a cabinet paper the <a href="https://environment.govt.nz/assets/publications/REDACTED-Emissions-Budgets-for-2022-2025_2026-2030-and-2031-2035-cabinet.pdf">accounting trick of
exporting our refinery emissions</a>
(along with the GDP) while probably increasing global emissions.</p>

<p>The refinery is currently in the state of a regular shutdown and can be brought back on line but the next step for the <a href="">Fuel Retailing Cartel</a>
is to start selling off this precious asset so this year&rsquo;s balance sheet looks good since they have missed out on historc refining profits.</p>

<p>The Fuel Retailing Cartel have asset stripped the refinery they were gifted by the NZ public in a way which
would shame a Yeltsin-era Russian oligarch.
