<p>Refinery closure to underpin emissions budget
Greta Yeoman - Mon, 9 May 2022</p>
<p>New Zealand’s first three emissions budgets are tighter than previously proposed, Climate Change Minister James Shaw announced this morning.</p>
<p>All three have decreased by two megatonnes a year of carbon dioxide equivalent compared to the proposals in the Ministry for the Environment’s discussion document last year.</p>
<p>But the first budget period will overwhelmingly rely on the cessation of refining at Marsden Point to meet about 80 per cent of its targets.</p>
<p>The first emissions budget period — which started on 1 January this year and will end in 2025 — will cap the country’s emissions at 290 megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases, an average of 72.4 Mt a year.</p>
<p>This is two Mt per year less than the five-year average up to this point and 3.1 Mt less than projected emissions for the period, Shaw says.</p>
<p>But most of this is expected to be met by the Marsden Point oil refinery closure, which will reduce the country’s emissions by about 2.5 Mt in the first emissions budget period to 2025. That means the country will only have to reduce its projected emissions from other sources by an average of 0.6 Mt during this period.</p>
<p>Despite this, Shaw says it will be a challenge.</p>
<p>“Remember that there are only 42 months left of the first emissions budget period — it started on New Year’s Day this year. So even that is going to be tight, given the time lag between a policy decision and its actual effect.”</p>
<p>Shaw says Cabinet had initially proposed a different figure for the first period, based on updated forestry intentions. But it has reverted to the Climate Change Commission’s recommendation after reviewing the evidence.</p>
<p>“There is considerable uncertainty around forestry projections,” he says.</p>
<p>There is also uncertainty over other projections – mostly notably the potential continuation of aluminium smelting at Tiwai Point.</p>
<p>Second and third budgets</p>
<p>Shaw says the CCC will review the latest evidence and update its before Cabinet finalises the next emissions budget in 2024 and then the one after than in 2029.</p>
<p>“The second and third emissions budgets have also been set in principle as Cabinet will review the latest evidence and update advice when setting further budgets in 2024 and 2029,” Shaw says.</p>
<p>“That will take into account not just more recent and firmer forestry projections, but also uptake of new technology and scientific advances.”</p>
<p>The five-year second budget period (2026-2030) has been set at 305 Mt, an average of 61 Mt per year. This will be 13.4 Mt or nearly 20 per cent per annum lower than emissions from 2017-2021.</p>
<p>The third period, from 2031-2035, is also set — in principle — at 240 Mt, an average of 48 Mt per year. This is about 35 per cent (26.4 Mt) less than 2017-2021.</p>
<p>“The nature and momentum of those changes, of course, will rely in large part on what we are able to achieve through our first Emissions Reduction Plan,” Shaw says.</p>
<p>Emissions reduction plan</p>
<p>“The emissions budgets are a sinking lid on our emissions, the stepping stones by which we begin the next stage of our journey to net-zero,” Shaw says.</p>
<p>While Shaw has revealed the targets today, the Emissions Reduction Plan’s details will be released next Monday.</p>
<p>That day, Minister of Finance Grant Robertson will also outline the first investments from the Climate Emergency Response Fund — funding that will go towards the first round of initiatives within the ERP.</p>
<p>The previously ad-hoc coordination of climate change policy across government will also be formalised into a fully-fledged Interdepartmental Executive Board, Shaw says.</p>
<p>The board — which will report up to the Climate Emergency Response Group of Ministers — will have its own secretariat and the ability to directly commission work.</p>
<p>The two groups will also develop and implement policy and make decisions on funding from the Climate Emergency Response Fund.</p>
<p>Parliamentary discussion</p>
<p>The first three emissions budgets will also be discussed in Parliament on Thursday, Shaw says.</p>
<p>“The Climate Change Commission recommended that we hold a special Parliamentary debate on the first three emissions budgets, prior to the publication of the Emissions Reduction Plan itself,” he says.</p>
<p>“After all, the first three emissions budgets take us through to 2035, which would span the life of several governments.</p>
<p>“This would allow each party to put its views on record and, at the same time, preserve each party’s ability to disagree on the policy prescription by which we collectively meet those emissions budgets.”</p>
