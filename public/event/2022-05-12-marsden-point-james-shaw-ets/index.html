<p>But most of this is expected to be met by the Marsden Point oil refinery closure, which will reduce the countryâ€™s emissions by about 2.5 Mt in the first emissions budget period to 2025. That means the country will only have to reduce its projected emissions from other sources by an average of 0.6 Mt during this period.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The First Union said last month that, if the Marsden Point refinery did close, the net result would be a net rise in global carbon emissions.</p>
