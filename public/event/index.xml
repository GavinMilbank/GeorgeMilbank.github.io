      <description>https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/466970/nz-s-first-three-emissions-budgets-guaranteed-with-non-partisan-support-minister
 But most of this is expected to be met by the Marsden Point oil refinery closure, which will reduce the country’s emissions by about 2.5 Mt in the first emissions budget period to 2025. That means the country will only have to reduce its projected emissions from other sources by an average of 0.6 Mt during this period.
 The First Union said last month that, if the Marsden Point refinery did close, the net result would be a net rise in global carbon emissions.</description>

      <description>2014-05-17 Refining NZ AGM - Fee Structure 2014-05-10 Refining shareholder faces unequal battle
   The company’s poor governance structure has contributed to its current problems.
    The board is dominated by oil company executives who are constantly changing. For example Refining NZ has had 44 different directors over the past decade.
    In addition the refinery’s chief executive or general manager has often been seconded from one of the major oil companies.</description>

      <description>Refining NZ listed on the NZX in September 1962, received its first tanker of Kuwait feedstock in February 1964 and was officially opened by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake three months later. Refinery margins were government controlled. The original refinery was built as a simple hydroskimming refinery, which is a crude distiller unit with limited secondary upgrading. Prime Minister Robert Muldoon included the expansion of the Marsden Point refinery as one of his “Think Big” projects in the early 1980s.</description>
