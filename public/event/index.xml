      <description>2020-04-15 Indpendent Report for MBIE - Impact of Conversion to Fuels Terminal  The change of the Marsden Point facility to a fuels terminal would have a significant impact of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s fuel security including:  A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely to impact New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s supply security; An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks covering at least 90 days of New Zealand&amp;rsquo;s daily net import requirement; The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast); No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions; Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP; No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2; Loss of technical processing expertise; and Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).</description>
