# whatsthepoint

- if stability of fuel prices and supply is what we are worried about we should be concerned about desturctions of marsden point
- it's a big energy insurance olicy for us
- if we lose it we have no alternative to taking feul prces n the international market - we might not even get any - 
  so the worst case goes from make our own a little ineffieciently (without the scale a subsidies of the Asian mega-refineries) perhaps
  to bnot having any fuel.
- the world is obivosly chaning and we should plan to that - or at least take some time to reevalute (considering that all the deiciosn werre made during COIVD)

- a fuel tax could be used to geet the asset through

- destrorying the point (decommission) - should mothball at a minimum - or just defer
- decision was made during covid


- shareholder are the energy retailers - price fixing carttel - they simply want tthe cheeapest petrol
- so called "green" energy is not even close to near an alternative
