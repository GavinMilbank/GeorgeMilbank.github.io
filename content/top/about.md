# Our Kaupapa

The Marsden Point Refinery is New Zealand Industrial [Taonga](https://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=taongahttps://maoridictionary.co.nz/search?keywords=taonga). In summary, we beleive that:

We should preserve it for our future economic resilience as we smoothly and safely modenrize our energy sources.

- Marsden Point is critcal for Neww Zealand economic resilience in a world of geopolitical shocks and global supply-chain breakdown.
- The decision to decomission Marsden Point was driven by 2 parties who do not have the econmic intererst of New Zealanders at heart:
    - a small ideoligcal faction in government on pursuit of political power
    - the very short term finaical interests of the shareholders
- The government can easily afford to buy an infulential or controlling stake the Refinery to facilitate a longer planning horizon.
- The Refinery and its very talented people can be tehcnological adapted for many enrreg needs.
- The Refinery is no more harrmful to the environemnt than any alteernatives propsoed.
- We should reconsider ETS if feasible.

We learnt a lot on this issue from the [wonderful work  of Chris Leitch](https://www.socialcredit.nz/refineryinfo).
