The release of the MBIE document advising against a future for refining (as they had done for oil and gas exploration and production) 
came just before the Covid demand shock and after a long period of profit extraction by the shareholders and low refining margins because
of excess capacity oversaes.

    - security of fuel supply for New Zealand 
    - importance of refining capability and optionality for fuel supply
    - the contribution of RNZ to the Northland economy
    - the role of RNZ’s skills and assets in a transition to lower carbon fuels

- According to Megan Woods (ideological and unproven):
> The coming years will see a complete re-wiring of global energy systems
  in response to the threat of climate change, and the economic and
  environmental opportunities low emissions energy sources are creating

    - RNZ reminds the government
        - RNZ refines imported crude intp 70% of NZ's transport fuel need.
        - Import of refined products equates to an export of GDP.
        - The refinery is a platform for the production of low emission fuels.

This briefing provides our preliminary views on the fuel supply impacts if Refining NZ were to
cease its refinery operations and convert its Marsden Point facility to a fuel import terminal.
Recommended action
The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) recommends that you:

    1. Strategic importance of maintaining refining capacity in New Zealand.
    2. Impact of change to import model on NZ's IEA oil stock obligation.
    3. Changes in government policy for fuel supply chain resilience.
    4. Options for RNZ to access cheaper electricity and gas.
    5. Longer term EITE allocations under the ETS
    6. How RNZ’s assets and people may help with low carbon transition. 
- [2020-06-06 **Megan Woods reply to RNZ**](oia/Doc%204%20-%20Hon%20Dr%20Megan%20Woods%20to%20Naomi%20James%20190620.pdf)
    1. Strategic importance was acknowledged, but not the risks.
    2. IEA obligation - extra storage costs probably passed onto the consumer.
    3. Control of fuel infrastructure - proobably not going to happen.
    4. Electricity and gas - speak to the suppliers
    5. Industrial allocatioon under ETS - a risk for RNZ  
    6. Transition to low carbon - Government could not incorpoarte the refinery into their low-carrbon plans.
