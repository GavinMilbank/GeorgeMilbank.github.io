  - Highly skilled jobs and manufacturing capability 
        - RNZ currently employs around 400 people directly, a similar number indirectly
        - Less demand for the current New Zealand coastal shipping fleet
        - RNZ contributes about \$10 million to the largely fixed cost of supplying electricity, water and other utilities
        - RNZ employs about 120 skilled engineers with specialist expertise in energy whose skills may not have alternate sources of employment in New Zealand.
        - Mothballing would need several years to re-start. Demolition and site rremeidation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
    - Transition to future domestic hydrogen and liquid biofuels industries 

As MBIE pushed ahead with apthe decision not to act to preven the Marsden Point Refinery closure, they commissioined the report [Refining NZ: Impact of conversion to fuels terminal](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/15260-refining-nz-impact-of-conversion-to-fuels-terminal). 

commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:
- A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely 
 to impact New Zealand's supply security
- An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks
covering at least 90 days of New Zealand's daily net import requirement;
- The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that 
 (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast)
- No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification 
  which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions
- Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP;
- No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2;
- Loss of technical processing expertise;
- Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).
