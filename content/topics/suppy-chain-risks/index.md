## [Addressing New Zealand's oil Security in 2040](Dalley-Thesis.pdf)

> How might changes in the geopolitical environment affect the efficacy of New Zealand’s current oil security assessments and policies out to 2040?
Through document analysis and utilising a scenario-based approach, this research has found that New Zealand’s current oil security assessments and corresponding policy recommendations do not adequately address geopolitical uncertainty. 

With the identified limitations of current assessments in mind, this study has identified a number of ways that New Zealand’s oil security assessments could be improved. These recommendations include:
i. Framing their external disruption scenarios upon the actual structure of the country’s supply chain and its sector dependencies, rather than global supply disruption estimates;
ii. Modelling for different scales of disruption, and supply line sector and market failure;
iii. Modelling supply chain disruptions to include anticipated delays in receiving unaffected supply from alternate sources, including from IEA members;
iv. Evaluating the vulnerability of other states that share suppliers and supply lines with New Zealand, and their ability to respond to the stock-sharing component of IEP where applicable;
v. Entertaining higher levels of uncertainty with respect to market and IEA emergency response failure under different scenarios;
vi. Maintaining an up-to-date schedule of alternative crude supply sources that meet New Zealand’s specifications, and integrating this information into risk assessments;
vii. Evaluating risk of disruption on sector-by-sector basis, accounting for levels of tightness, concentration and flexibility and investment within associated upstream,

midstream and downstream markets, and the extent that supply is being traded through open market channels;
viii. Maintain an ongoing review of geopolitical developments to feed into modelling, adopting an ‘adaptive management’ approach to oil security planning and policymaking;
ix. Adopting a long time-horizon for policymaking, likely at least 10 years given constraints on energy system transformation.

This study has also highlighted a number of oil security-improving policy instruments and strategies that should be considered if New Zealand’s supply security is found to be at an unsatisfactory level. This most notably includes modifying the country’s stockholding approach, utilising foreign policy instruments to provide additional options in an emergency, and reducing oil dependence entirely through working to increase the country’s adoption of alternative energy technologies.
