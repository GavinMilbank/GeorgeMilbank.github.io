> Over FY21, Z has supported the strategic
review of Refining NZ’s operations.
This review has made it clear that
Refining NZ’s future is as a fuel import
terminal rather than a sub-scale refiner
of crude oil.
> Shifting to a fuel import terminal will
remove Z’s exposure to refining margins
and reduce the volatility of earnings
and operating expenses.
> Over FY21, climate change has
emerged as a highly material issue for
Z’s stakeholders. We’re not surprised.
The Government has declared a climate
emergency, the effects of a warming
climate continue to be felt and, at the time
of publication, there is ongoing private
legal action taken by an individual against
Z and a number of other companies
around the impacts of climate change.
