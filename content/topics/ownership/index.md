Losing the refinery is another step on the path to a loss of national economic sovreignty.
As the world engages in re-shoring of supply chains and a rollback of naive globablism we should
retain some form of ownership of the refinery to give us economic optionality and value.
In particular the transfer of national assets to unrestricted private ownership where very often is foreign
with no allegiance to the New Zealand people. Tbe globalization and extreme market approach to 




It concerns us that we are very late in shutting down a precious physical asset which we paid for
simply to increase the profit sof a foreign company at a time where the economic zeitgiest is for reshoring industry.

> Over FY21, Z has supported the strategic
review of Refining NZ’s operations.
This review has made it clear that
Refining NZ’s future is as a fuel import
terminal rather than a sub-scale refiner
of crude oil.
> Shifting to a fuel import terminal will
remove Z’s exposure to refining margins
and reduce the volatility of earnings
and operating expenses.
> Over FY21, climate change has
emerged as a highly material issue for
Z’s stakeholders. We’re not surprised.
The Government has declared a climate
emergency, the effects of a warming
climate continue to be felt and, at the time
of publication, there is ongoing private
legal action taken by an individual against
Z and a number of other companies
around the impacts of climate change.
