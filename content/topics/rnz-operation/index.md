We have the same product but all the technical expertsie and GDP and  economic activitiy which 


Unless substituets are found and they are hard to find. Businesses of this size and complexity to not spring up overnight. 
In the worst case we have lost all ther econocmic acticity overseas, 
in the best it will take some years to build up just when we need it most recpvering from COVID. 
Profits stay wehere they have always been with largely foreign investors.

- 40% of the total energy needs of New Zealand
- 70% of the country’s transport fuel needs
- 100% of Auckland Airport’s jet fuel

- The Marsden Point Oil Refinery is capable of processing enough oil to meet a majority of domestic demand.
- Refining NZ processes crude oil and condensate for the 3 biggest oil companies active in New Zealand — BP, Mobil and Z Energy. Each of these companies has a stake in the refinery, with other shareholders holding a minority.
- The refinery produces a full range of petroleum products: petrol — diesel, kerosene-type jet-A1, fuel oil, bitumen and other petroleum products — but not aviation gasoline or lubricants.
- Sulphur is recovered as a by-product and sold as a feedstock to the fertiliser industry. Recovered carbon dioxide is sold to the food and beverage industry.
- The trend towards super-refineries no-one cares.
- NZ doesn't refine its own petroleum - but we could if the tankers just didn't get here!
