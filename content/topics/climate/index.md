We disagree with the premise of the great urgency of a move away from fossil fuels although an increasing 
depedence on alternatives is probably inevitable and desirable. One reason the NZ government let the 
refinery close was to meet climate emissions targets expressed through the ETS.
Observed temperature change and well whithin the bounds of natural variation from the historical
recrod when man was not influencing the composition of the atmospehre in any way.
The likelihood of the harmful future man-made CO<sub>2</sub> driven gobal warming apppears low 
and the mitigations appear to be ineffectual and disastrously costly to our societies.
The uncertainities in the current models don't allow for great confidence in the forecasts.
It is great folly to base policy off the forecasts. 
We do however believe in the sense of some amount of elasticity in nature, so we think it is important to keep a balance of biomass. In fact plants seem to be thriving with a slight increase in C0_<sub>2</sub> concentration.

## [IPCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change)

The IPCC lays out the scientific basis and policy mitigations of climate change.

## State of the Science Behind Climate Change

We try to outline the structural features of the climate system which make such things as average
global temperature difficult to even define, let alone measure, and which make forecasts highly uncertain.
We admire 3 skeptics in particular whose measured sagacity and obvious intelligence, as well as their 
arguments appeal to us.

A smattering of the issues are:

- the predominant greenhouse gas (H<sub>2</sub>0) is near its triple point, and has very different
  radiative properties in different phases.
- clouds
- we have no control over the forcing of the sun
- there are very large capacitances aleady in the system (the sea)
- dust

>- Five reservoirs of carbon all are in close contact — the atmosphere, the upper level of the ocean, the land vegetation, the topsoil, and the fossil fuels. They are all about equal in size. They all interact with each other strongly. So you can’t understand any of them unless you understand all of them
>- Syukuro Manabe (Princeton), was the first person who did climate models with enhanced carbon dioxide and they were excellent models. And he used to say very firmly that these models are very good tools for _understanding_ climate, but they are not good tools for _predicting_ climate

- 1/100 inch per year of biomass absorbs all the carbon.
- sparseness of observations
- superficial theories
- biosphere very important
- local warming due to more C02 

William Happer calculates the radiative balance sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentration
William Happer examines the transmission of infrared radiation through a cloud-free atmosphere from 
the Earth’s surface to outer space down the radiative properties of the problem in the paper 
[Dependence of Earth’s Thermal Radiation on Five Most Abundant Greenhouse Gases](./happer-greenhouse-gases.pdf)
which concludes that at current concentrations, the forcings from all greenhouse gases are saturated.

The earth also has a natural negative feedback against a pertubation of more heat (blackbody radiation at T<sup>4</sup]>).
The models need a positive feedback loop of water vapour to create their frightening warming scenarios.
These tipping point usually involve pahses changes of water (or CO_2 methane)
This is not likely and 

- 5 reservoirs of carbon on short time scale (of comparable size)
    - atmosphere
    - land plants
    - top soil
    - surface of ocean    
    - fossil fuels

### Climate Change Mechanismms (Wikipedia)

THe argument laid out in the [Climate Change Wikipedia artcile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change)

The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation), decades or even centuries.[54] Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is "external" to the climate system, but not always external to the Earth.[55] Examples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the.

Yet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing (so warming not due to the sun).
Everyone accepts the geeehouse effect.
Attribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.[59]


Global warming became the most popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S. Senate
Before the 1980s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling.

We can easily test how easy it is to sruvie in 1000 ppm C0<sub>2</sub>.


The ETS scheme attempts to price the purported climate damage casued by greenhouse gases but there are many falws to this system.
*Average ground temperature* is impossible to measure since most of the Earth is ocaen.
The measured attitude and skeptical attitudes of thess scientists really resonate with us:
An appeal to authority argument is more useful than imagined, but it does give you soe idea on the quality of the respective arguemtns.

      but he did not do well in science classes and avoided taking math.


## Economic Disataer All For Nothing

In summary, it seems that we are courting economic disaster on the flimsiest of scientific premises.
