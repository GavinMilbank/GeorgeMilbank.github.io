As it seems that the refinery was not supported as many other business have been through tough times based on a naive view of climate change we explain why we are skeptical about the science and why it is effectively immoral to have New Zealand taxpayers suffer on this basis.

We broadly believe that climate is a complex system whihc is exceeding difficult to forecast because of the non-linearities. phases changes and large time scales then the fact that we have no contorl of the largest forcing function - the sun.

We do however believe in the sense of some amount of elasticity in nature, so we think it is important to keep a balance of biomass. In fact plants seem to be thriving with a slight increase in C0_<sub>2</sub> concentration.

The measured attitude and skeptical attitudes of thess scientists really resonate with us:

- [Richard Lindzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lindzen)

You can look up there videos on Youtube. They are much more convincing than the Climate Change alarmists and certainly are of a different intellectual league from this [childish and dangerous nonsense from James Shaw](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/opinion/128650738/emissions-plan-could-herald-the-biggest-set-of-changes-in-nz-since-rogernomics).

We think that history will prove what a grand folly the climate change panic was (even though it would be wise an moral not to be wasteful and to do what we can to keep biomass).
