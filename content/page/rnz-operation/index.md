- 40% of the total energy needs of New Zealand
- 70% of the country’s transport fuel needs
- 100% of Auckland Airport’s jet fuel

- The Marsden Point Oil Refinery is capable of processing enough oil to meet a majority of domestic demand.
- Refining NZ processes crude oil and condensate for the 3 biggest oil companies active in New Zealand — BP, Mobil and Z Energy. Each of these companies has a stake in the refinery, with other shareholders holding a minority.
- The refinery produces a full range of petroleum products: petrol — diesel, kerosene-type jet-A1, fuel oil, bitumen and other petroleum products — but not aviation gasoline or lubricants.
- Sulphur is recovered as a by-product and sold as a feedstock to the fertiliser industry. Recovered carbon dioxide is sold to the food and beverage industry.
- The trend towards super-refineries no-one cares.
- NZ doesn't refine its own petroleum - but we could if the tankers just didn't get here!
