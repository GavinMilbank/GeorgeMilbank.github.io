## [2014-05-17 Refining NZ AGM - Fee Structure](https://milfordasset.com/insights/briscoe-refining-nz-tale-two-agms)

- The picture painted by Jackson and chief executive Sjoerd Post was that all of Refining NZ’s problems were caused by external factors and the company was not responsible for its difficult situation. This is not the full picture, as the company’s history shows.
-  In the late 1950’s the government gave the go ahead for the construction of a refinery at Marsden Point with the major oil companies owning about two-thirds of the shares and domestic investors the remainder.
- The company listed on the NZX in September 1962, received its first tanker of Kuwait feedstock in February 1964 and was officially opened by Prime Minister Keith Holyoake three months later. Refinery margins were government controlled.
- The original refinery was built as a simple hydroskimming refinery, which is a crude distiller unit with limited secondary upgrading.
- Prime Minister Robert Muldoon included the expansion of the Marsden Point refinery as one of his “Think Big” projects in the early 1980s.
  This expansion was based around a hydrocracker, which produces much higher value products than the hydroskimming process.
- The 1980s expansion, which was beset with labour problems, cost overruns and delays, was completed two years late at a final cost of $1.84 billion.
- As part of the deregulation of the refining sector in 1988 Refining NZ was “gifted” the hydrocracker expansion and given an additional $85 million cash grant. 
- `In other words Refining NZ was given a brand new hydrocracker, which had cost $1.84 billion, while the borrowings associated with this expansion remained with taxpayers.`
- The company’s poor governance structure has contributed to its current problems. The board is dominated by oil company executives who are constantly changing. For example Refining NZ has had 44 different directors over the past decade . 
- In addition the refinery’s chief executive or general manager has often been seconded from one of the major oil companies. `These oil companies, which have a combined 72.7 per cent shareholding, have maximised value from their shareholding through unrealistically high dividends and a favourable processing fee arrangement.`
- The controversial fee, which was changed to a market-related formula in 1995, is based on Singapore refinery processing fees. Refining NZ received 70 per cent of this with the remaining 30 per cent rebated back to the oil companies.
- Halliwell has been a constant critic of this 70/30 split but this year he went a step further by claiming that the major oil producers were given an additional rebate that could take their total rebate from 30 per cent to 65 per cent.
- Post totally rejected Halliwell’s claim although the issue is complicated by annual negotiations that adjusts the processing fee downward for a number of oil company costs, including the transportation of crude to Marsden Point. These additional cost reductions could be the basis of Halliwell’s latest claims.
- But the big lesson from the Marsden Point meeting is that it is tough going for minority shareholders in New Zealand, particularly if a company is dominated by big multi-nationals.
- Shareholder abuse - the Fuel Retailing Cartel ran the refinery into the ground 
- The meeting ended after 131 minutes and shareholders were provided a modest offering of tea, coffee and traditional cakes and savouries as befitting the company’s poor performance.
- At the close of trade on Thursday Refining NZ had a sharemarket value of $572 million even though it had been gifted a $1.84 billion hydrocracker expansion, received an $85 million cash grant from the Crown and has $267.1 million of subscribed capital.

## [2014-05-17 Refining shareholder faces unequal battle](https://milfordasset.com/insights/refining-shareholder-faces-unequal-battle)


- the cartel effectiveyl controlled Refining NZ
- 1995 when Refining NZ changed the processing fee it charges to its main shareholders from one based on a combination of a fixed, variable and market-related costs to one that is totally market-related.
-  This market-related fee is effectively based on 70 per cent of Singapore refinery fees with a minimum and maximum fee, the latter being US$9 ($10.40) a barrel. 
- Effectively 70 per cent of the refinery margin goes to Refining NZ with the remaining 30 per cent rebated back to the oil company shareholders.
- The 1995 independent appraisal report, which was issued in conjunction with the fee changes, stated that “the allocation of 30 per cent to the user companies together with their indirect interest (shareholding) should provide a sufficient incentive for them to optimise their use of Refining NZ’s capacity” - WHY ? This report, as with most independent reports, concluded that “the terms and conditions of the processing arrangements are fair” to minority shareholders.
- The report contained forecasts of total processing fees of $900.7 million over the first five years of the new formula. The actual fees were $666.1 million over this five-year period, 26 per cent below the forecast at the time of the fee change.
- Halliwell first brought the issue before shareholders at the 2010 annual meeting when he proposed a motion asking the board “to arrange for Hale and Toomey to carry out a study” on the processing fee.
- Chairman David Jackson told the meeting that “the board has agreed that in future the independent directors will play a more significant and defined role” in relation to the processing fee. 
- Refining’s chief financial officer, Denise Jensen, emailed this column a week before the April 2010 annual meeting with the following points:
  - The 30 per cent discount granted to the oil users was not a “loyalty discount”. She wrote that the 30 per cent discount reflects “the fact that Refining NZ’s customers bear the risks and associated costs of crude purchasing; finance and currency costs; risks associated with maintaining crude feedstock and product inventory; shipping and demurrage risks; and guaranteeing a minimum processing fee”.
  - Refining would only release a summary of the 2009 Purvin and Gertz report because the full study “is very detailed and includes certain proprietary information of Purvin and Gertz”.
  - The company had taken legal advice regarding the right of the oil company shareholders to vote on issues relating to the processing fee and this advice determined that “under general company law, shareholders are entitled to vote at a shareholders’ meeting even if they are ‘interested’ in the proposed resolution”.
- Halliwell was back at the 2013 annual meeting with three resolutions. The main one was, “That the shareholders disagree with the present 30 per cent/70 per cent gain sharing arrangement” in relation to the processing fee.
- Halliwell has proposed the following resolution at next week’s annual meeting: “I move that, in view of their continued support for the user companies’ invalid, pre-costs, “gain sharing” discounts … shareholders have no confidence in the willingness of the directors, and the chief executive” to act in the best interests of the company
- Halliwell wrote in the notice of meeting that the “refinery operates close to 100 per cent capacity, for 24 hours/365 days. But in 2013 (December 31 year) it lost 0.5 cents on each of the 6.4 billion litres it produced. Meanwhile, the users received invalid discounts, of about $300 million”.
- Halliwell is persistent but the big problem is that the oil companies don’t have to use the Ruakaka refinery, they can source product from cheaper refineries.
- Z Energy confirmed this point during the week when chief executive Mike Bennetts said that his company had sourced product from a South Korean refinery.
- For example, Jackson told last year’s annual meeting that the company expected to achieve “strong revenue generation” even though business conditions remained volatile and difficult.
- The actual outcome was a decline in revenue from $277.5 million in the December 2012 year to $221.9 million in 2013 and a loss of $5 million compared with a 2012 year profit of $31.1 million.
- Chief executive Sjoerd Post also told the 2013 meeting that the company aimed to achieve “first quartile NZX50 returns for shareholders”.
- In addition, the recent refinery shutdown was 22 days longer than planned and this will have an impact on December 2014 revenue and earnings.
- The simple issue with Refining NZ is that the four big oil company shareholders receive a 30 per cent discount on their refinery processing fee while the remaining 3600 minority shareholders receive well below average sharemarket returns.
