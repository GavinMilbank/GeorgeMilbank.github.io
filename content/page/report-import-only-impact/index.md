The [March 2020 Hale and Twomey report](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/15260-refining-nz-impact-of-conversion-to-fuels-terminal) commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:

- A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely 
 to impact New Zealand's supply security
- An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks
covering at least 90 days of New Zealand's daily net import requirement;
- The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that 
 (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast)
- No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification 
  which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions
- Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP;
- No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2;
- Loss of technical processing expertise;
- Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).

Apparently MBIE didn't like it, because they then made a [very weak argument for supply chain robustness](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/15257-fuel-security-and-fuel-stockholding-costs-and-benefits-2020)
