`Transtion away from Fossil Fuels` - We reject that premise !

Marsden Point Refinery is a critical piece of infrastructure which until recently provided:

- 70% of NZ's transport [energy needs]()
- 70% of NZ's roading [bitumen]()
- [CO<sub>2</sub>]() for food processing
- [sulphur]() for fertlizer[^1]

And is slated for destruction by 

- The corrupt [Fuel Retailing Cartel]() 
- The naive and incompetent [Government Green Ideologues]()

As the country moves to an import only model which

- exposes NZ to supply, price and quality [risks]()
- removes options for econonnmic [return]() via development of our [domestic energy resources]()

But we can act now to [save the refinery](https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz/)

- it currently in the state of a regular shutdown but can still be salvaged 
- we can examine options for a planning horizon longer than what the current equity strucutre encourages
- as the government has done for Air NZ, Tiwai Point Ihumatao

In fact a [cabinet paper to save the refinery]() was proposed by [Megan Woods]() which stated 
`loan or similar underwriting facility could support Refining NZ through “the current period of low earnings”, which Woods expected to persist for two to three years` but this was ultimately endorsed by fellow ministers. The comically bad accuracy of Woods' forecast was immediately observed with the historic surge in refining margins courtesy of geopolitics.

A reason for this deceitful sabotage of our economy became clear when [James Shaw]() announced his [emissions budgets](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/emissions-budgets-and-the-emissions-reduction-plan/) noting in a [cabinet paper](https://environment.govt.nz/assets/publications/REDACTED-Emissions-Budgets-for-2022-2025_2026-2030-and-2031-2035-cabinet.pdf) the accounting trick of 
exporting our refinery emissions. technology and GDP for this vainglorious goal.

With the closure of Marsden Point we have clearly increased our fuel supply chain risk becasue we have added an external dependencies on refining and shipping to the refinery. If we can process our own crude, then we eliminate external risks. We can't let these clowns wreck our country. You can join groups such as the [Dig-In at Marsden Point](https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz) to fight back against this insanity and keep some refining capacity in New Zealand and not export our indsutry, our GDP and our future.
