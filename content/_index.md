Marsden Point Refinery is a critical piece of infrastructure which until recently provided:

- 70% of NZ's transport [energy needs]()
- 70% of NZ's roading [bitumen]()
- [CO<sub>2</sub>]() for food processing
- [sulphur]() for fertlizer[^1]

And is slated for destruction by 

- Refining NZ [Management]() and [Shareholders]()
- [Government green ideologues]()

As the country moves to an import only model which

- exposes NZ to supply, price and quality [risks]()
- removes options for development of our [domestic energy resources]()

But we can act now to [save the refinery](https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz/)

- it currently in the state of a regular shutdown but can still be salvaged 
- we can examine options for a planning horizon longer than what the current equity strucutre encourages.

Groups such as the [Dig-In at Marsden Point](https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz) are trying to raise awereness of the critical issue.
