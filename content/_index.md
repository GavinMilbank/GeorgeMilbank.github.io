# Save Marsden Point Oil Refinery

Marsden Point Refinery is currenty shut down, but [Refining NZ management]() want to destroy it. It critical piece of infrastructure which until the recent shutdown provided 

- 70% of NZ's transport [energy needs]()
- 70% of NZ's roading [bitumen]()
- [CO<sub>2</sub>]() for food processing d
- [sulphur]() for fertlizer 

This was taken during the Covid pandemic by:

- [The Fuel Retailing Cartel Shareholders]() for short term profit.
- [Refining NZ Management]() in pursuit of their short term bonuses.
- [Government green ideologues]() for politcal power and vanity.

ignoring the global supply shock, price and quality [risks]() of of moving to an [import only model]() 
and removing options for the development of our [domestic energy resources](). 
The foolishness of this move was immediately demonstrated as [geopolitcal events]() pushed [global refining margins](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYMEX-D1N1%21) to record highs
