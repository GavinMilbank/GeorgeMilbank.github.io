# Save Marsden Point Oil Refinery

Marsden Point Refinery is a critical piece of infrastructure which until recently provided:

- 70% of NZ's transport [energy needs]()
- 70% of NZ's roading [bitumen]()
- [CO<sub>2</sub>]() for food processing
- [sulphur]() for fertlizer[^1]

and is slated for destruction by 

- Refining NZ [Management]() and [Shareholders]()
- [Government green ideologues]()

as the country moves to an import only model which:

- expoes us supply, price and quality [risks]()
- remove options for development of our [domestic energy resources](). 

The foolishness of this move was immediately demonstrated as [geopolitcal events]() pushed [global refining margins](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYMEX-D1N1%21) to record highs. It currenty on the state of a regualr shutdown but can still be salvaged if [actin is taken qucikly](https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz/).
