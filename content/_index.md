In this site we present the argument that Marsden Point Refinery's fuel security and economic value to New Zealand
is such that the government or the refinery owners themselves should reconsider the decision to allow it to be decomissioned. Longer term it is probably a responsible government's role to secure the operation of the refinery as we safely and ethically evolve our energy use profile for the benefit of all New Zealanders.


Marsden Point Refinery is a critical piece of infrastructure which until recently provided most of NZ's 
transport fuel, roading [bitumen]() as well as CO<sub>2</sub> for food processing and
sulphur for fertlizer[^1]. It is slated for destruction by the controlling sharholders,
the [Fuel Cartel](), enabled by [Government Green Ideologues](), as the country moves to an import only model
which exposes NZ to [supply, price and quality risks](), exports all the [GDP associated with the refinery]() and removes [options for our economic and energy development]().

The basic acts in this tragedy are:

1. Fuel Cartel is gifted a $2B hydrocracker by the taxpayer
2. Fuel Cartel sucks profit out of the refinery over a numbner of years.
3. Refinery faces competition from Asian refinery over-capacity.
4. Ardern Government declares war on carbon.
5. Fuel Cartel arranges to permanently close the refinery during the Covid.
6. Ardern Government declines to help the refinery to survive Covid.
7. Fuel Cartel writes off the refinery for a 500M loas (and probable tax credit.) 
8. Refinery profitability hits historic highs as refinery is shut down.
9. Refinery CEO doubles her compensation as company makes loss
10. Ardern Government books the Carbon emmission savings from closing the refinery.
11. International supply chain continue to fail - geopolitical

In 1988 Refining NZ got a $2 billon refinery paid for by the taxpayer. The main shareholders, the fuel retailing cartel 
sucked profits out of the refinery and into their downstream businesses over many years by giving themselves a 30% discount on the refinery product. Even given the need to compete with cheaper mega-refineries principally in Asia, there is clearly increased supply chain risk in having offshore refineries as the only source of refined products. The government appears to have been influenced by emissions reduction goals not to offer to help the refinery even over the Covid downturn as it did for every other business. The almost comic incompetence of the decision to close the refinery was immediately showcased with the refining business surging to 
[historic profitability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjNqvObCfKc) as supply chain and geopolitical risks skyrocket.

However mis-timing the refining market completely has been good for [Refining NZ]()'s CEO [Naomi James]()' compensation. Perhaps the doubling of her salary was reward for writing off the refinery taxpayers paid for to reduce [Channel Infrastructure]() tax liability for years into the future.

Because of the refinery's obvious importance Megan Woods did float the idea of 
[a loan to save the refinery]() as has been done in Australia, but this was rejected by [cabinet]().  A motive for this economic sabotage became clear when [James Shaw]() announced his [emissions budgets](https://environment.govt.nz/what-government-is-doing/areas-of-work/climate-change/emissions-budgets-and-the-emissions-reduction-plan/) noting in a cabinet paper the [accounting trick of exporting our refinery emissions](https://environment.govt.nz/assets/publications/REDACTED-Emissions-Budgets-for-2022-2025_2026-2030-and-2031-2035-cabinet.pdf) 
(along with the GDP) while probably increasing global emissions.

The very basis of the dramatic push to decarbonize the economy is based on the flakiest science, 
and in fact represents a huge transfer of wealth towards the rich insiders in the economy and
certainly away from Western industry and towards China in particular which has far weaker environmental regulations.
As is fashionable, we reject the premise of this motive for closing the Refinery which taxpayers bought and gifted to the Fuel Cartel.

The refinery is currently in the state of a regular shutdown and can be brought back on line but the next step for the [Fuel Cartel]() 
is to start selling off this precious asset so this year's balance sheet looks good since they have missed out on historc refining profits.

You can stop them by joining groups such as the [Dig-In at Marsden Point](https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz) to fight back against this insanity.
