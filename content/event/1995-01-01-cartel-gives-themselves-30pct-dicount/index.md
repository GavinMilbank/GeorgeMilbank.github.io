[2014-05-17 Refining NZ AGM - Fee Structure](https://milfordasset.com/insights/briscoe-refining-nz-tale-two-agms)
[2014-05-10 Refining shareholder faces unequal battle](https://milfordasset.com/insights/refining-shareholder-faces-unequal-battle)

- > The company’s poor governance structure has contributed to its current problems. 
- > The board is dominated by oil company executives who are constantly changing. For example Refining NZ has had 44 different directors over the past decade. 
- > In addition the refinery’s chief executive or general manager has often been seconded from one of the major oil companies.
- > These oil companies, which have a combined 72.7 per cent shareholding, have maximised value from their shareholding through unrealistically high dividends and a favourable processing fee arrangement.
- > The controversial fee, which was changed to a market-related formula in 1995, is based on Singapore refinery processing fees. Refining NZ received 70 per cent of this with the remaining 30 per cent rebated back to the oil companies.
- > At the close of trade on Thursday Refining NZ had a sharemarket value of $572 million even though it had been gifted a $1.84 billion hydrocracker expansion, received an $85 million cash grant from the Crown and has $267.1 million of subscribed capital.
- > Refining’s chief financial officer, Denise Jensen, emailed this column a week before the April 2010 annual meeting with the following points:
  - > The 30 per cent discount granted to the oil users was not a “loyalty discount”. She wrote that the 30 per cent discount reflects “the fact that Refining NZ’s customers bear the risks and associated costs of crude purchasing; finance and currency costs; risks associated with maintaining crude feedstock and product inventory; shipping and demurrage risks; and guaranteeing a minimum processing fee”.
  - > Refining would only release a summary of the 2009 Purvin and Gertz report because the full study “is very detailed and includes certain proprietary information of Purvin and Gertz”.
  - > The company had taken legal advice regarding the right of the oil company shareholders to vote on issues relating to the processing fee and this advice determined that “under general company law, shareholders are entitled to vote at a shareholders’ meeting even if they are ‘interested’ in the proposed resolution”.
- > Halliwell wrote in the notice of meeting that the “refinery operates close to 100 per cent capacity, for 24 hours/365 days. But in 2013 (December 31 year) it lost 0.5 cents on each of the 6.4 billion litres it produced. Meanwhile, the users received invalid discounts, of about $300 million”.
- > Z Energy confirmed this point during the week when chief executive Mike Bennetts said that his company had sourced product from a South Korean refinery.
- > For example, Jackson told last year’s annual meeting that the company expected to achieve “strong revenue generation” even though business conditions remained volatile and difficult.
  - > The actual outcome was a decline in revenue from $277.5 million in the December 2012 year to $221.9 million in 2013 and a loss of $5 million compared with a 2012 year profit of $31.1 million.
- > The simple issue with Refining NZ is that the four big oil company shareholders receive a 30 per cent discount on their refinery processing fee while the remaining 3600 minority shareholders receive well below average sharemarket returns.
