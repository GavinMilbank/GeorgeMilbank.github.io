    - RNZ madee the decision to close the refinery in 2020 the most challenging in its 60 year history
        - Why wasn't it supporrted like other businesses ?
        - Thie year would have been the most profitable
    - RNZ also owns and operates the Refinery-Auckland Pipeline (RAP).
    - Government only seemed interested in import terminal and 
    - Import only results in big reduction in stock - The Hale and Twomey reports outlines the dangers.
    - NZs rservers are held in tickets.
    - RNZ advised durring phase 1 that closing the refinery would not reduce NZ fuel security 
      given the "diversity and robustness of product import supplu chains"
