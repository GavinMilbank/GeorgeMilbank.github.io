    4. Options for RNZ to access cheaper electricity and gas.
    5. Longer term EITE allocations under the ETS

    1. Strategic importance was acknowledged, but not the risks.
    2. IEA obligation - extra storage costs probably passed onto the consumer.
    3. Control of fuel infrastructure - proobably not going to happen.
    4. Electricity and gas - speak to the suppliers
    5. Industrial allocatioon under ETS - a risk for RNZ  
    6. Transition to low carbon - Government could not incorpoarte the refinery into their low-carrbon plans.
