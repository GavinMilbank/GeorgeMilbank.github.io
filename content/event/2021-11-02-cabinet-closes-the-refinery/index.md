After a period of consultation Megan Woods signed the deth notice of the refinery with the release of the cabinet paper 
[MBIE Cabinet Paper - Fuel supply resilience without a domestic oil refinery](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/17733-fuel-supply-resilience-without-a-domestic-oil-refinery-proactiverelease-pdf).

>  Subject to a final decision by Refining NZ, due by 30 September 2021, oil
refining operations are expected to cease between March and June 2022, after which 100 per
cent of refined fuels will be imported. I propose to progress development of options to ensure
domestic fuel stock levels remain adequate, as a means of supporting fuel supply resilience,
as New Zealand transitions away from fossil fuels. 
> There does not appear to be a clear case for maintaining refinery operations for fuel resilience
reasons, except to address an exceptional ‘no fuel imports’ scenario.
>  I have considered an option to support Refining NZ to ensure the refinery continues operating
for a period of time – perhaps five or 10 years – by limiting its exposure to volatile earnings.
The Government could provide a loan or similar underwrite facility to support Refining NZ
through the current period of low earnings (expected to persist for two to three years).
> I do not believe there is a strong case to support continued refinery operations on fuel security
grounds but I acknowledge there are broader considerations. I am therefore open to
commencing discussions with Refining NZ on that option, should Cabinet invite me to do so.
> The planned closure is a response to very challenging global refining market conditions, with
significant surplus refining capacity following recent investment in new, large-scale, export
refineries in the region that have better efficiency and lower emissions intensity
>  Industry and independent expert advice is that a refined fuel import supply chain can provide
more supply source diversity (from multiple refineries in different regions), and is more
resilient to most credible fuel disruption scenarios. CLEARLY NOT TRUE AS WE JUST GVIE UP AN OPTION.
> I do not propose subsidising the refinery to keep it operating for 5 or 10 years because I
consider the fuel import risk to be small, and I propose instead to progress options to ensure
New Zealand has adequate fuel stocks in-country to offset any fuel import risk. I also consider
the other adverse impacts of the planned closure are manageable and do not warrant
measures that would, among other things, make it harder for us to meet the first emissions
reduction budget. WE NEED A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE FUELS - for hyrdo and feothermal we need to build the infra.
> Minimum stock levels could be set at current commercial levels or increased above current levels to offset a potential
reduction in supply resilience when refining operations cease. CONTRADICTION
> This is the culmination of a strategic review underway since April 2020 in response to very challenging
global refining market conditions that may not improve for some years. WE SJHOULD HAVE TAKEN THE REFINERY OFF THEM or simply tariffed.
>  A structural change in refining markets arising from the increased supply of refined product
and a lower than expected growth in demand for transport fuels in the Asia-Pacific region has
resulted in very weak refining margins and uncertainty regarding future refining margins
>  Even if refining market conditions improve, oil refining in New Zealand is expected to become
unsustainable, around 2035, due to declining use of fossil fuels as New Zealand adopts
electric vehicles and lower emission fuels, including drop-in biofuels. 
> 20. Refining NZ’s proposed conversion to an import terminal is not expected to have a material
impact on fuel prices, because the fuel market is already at import price parity, but it has a
number of potential adverse implications, including:
> a. Regional economy: 500 households
> b. Skilled workforce
> c. Potential co-production of biofuels:  closure of the refinery may close off opportunities to
use or re-purpose the refinery to produce biofuels alongside conventional fuels. BUT HOW DO BIOFULES REDUCE C02?
> d. Cost of compliance with the 90-day stockholding obligation under the International
Energy Agreement (IEA): closure of the refinery will require expenditure of up to $13
million per annum to procure more reserve stock (if procured offshore)
> e. Refining NZ is endeavouring to manage this staffing risk
 there is an elevated risk that a critical loss of staff could force in an earlier closure of the refinery.
> f. Fuel security/insurance: loss of ability to refine domestic crude oil could leave New
Zealand more exposed to the severe consequence of depleting all fuel stocks if unable
to import any fuel for a sustained period.
> g.  Bitumen supply: Refining NZ stopped producing bitumen in January 2021 mainly due to
economic factors as the manufacturing plant required capital investment.
> h.  Liquid CO2 supply: Food-grade liquid carbon dioxide, used in the food and beverage
sector and in some water treatment plant, is currently produced at the refinery and at the
Kapuni gas processing plant in Taranaki. There are two national suppliers – BOC and
Air Liquide. While there are other potential CO2 sources, including imports, closure of
the refinery will challenge the CO2 supply chain – particularly a short lead time to make
necessary investments or relocate plant. Options currently being explored include 
> 31. Without a domestic refinery, in a closed border event New Zealand would need to ration its
diesel stocks to maintain critical services for a limited period – perhaps a few months. 
> 32. While officials have not specifically assessed the impact of an extended “closed border”
scenario, they have considered the impact of a less severe scenario in which 50 per cent of
 Refining NZ advises the Marsden Point refinery cannot produce fuels solely from light Taranaki crude oils without significant reconfiguration that would take years to plan and implement. JUST DO THE CONVERSION.
> 33.  A global fuel product supply disruption is similar to the crude oil disruption scenario New
Zealand has always faced, except that product exporting countries (like South Korea and
Singapore) are typically less dependent on fuel export income than are crude exporting
countries, and may therefore be likely to prioritise domestic fuel security before allowing
exports in a global oil disruption. That said, New Zealand’s major product suppliers (and other
countries likely to supply fuel in an emergency like the United States) are IEA members and
are bound by that treaty to work together to share the impacts of a disruption that affects all or
any members.
> 34. Options to avoid or mitigate the adverse impacts described above include:
    > a. Delay the refinery closure until New Zealand is less dependent on imported fossil fuels.
    > b. Ensure sufficient fuel stocks are held in New Zealand at all times to provide an adequate buffer against an extended global fuel supply disruption.
    > c. Accelerate the development of a domestic biofuels industry, and electrification of
transport, to more rapidly reduce New Zealand’s reliance on imported fossil fuels.
> 36. Closure of the Marsden Point refinery will have little impact on global emissions but will
    substantially reduce domestic emissions by between 0.75 and 1.2 million tonnes of carbon
    dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2-e) each year. Closure will reduce emissions by between 2.5 and
    4.2 Mt CO2-e in the first emissions budget period, which equates roughly to 25 to 42 per cent
    of the required reductions in that period.
37. Any intervention to maintain oil refining Marsden Point would need to take into account the
impact on emissions and the Government’s domestic and international objective of achieving
a smooth and managed transition away from fossil fuels.
38. New Zealand is a leading advocate internationally for fossil fuel subsidy reform on the global
stage and is intensifying this advocacy in 2021 with initiatives such as the ongoing
negotiations on the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), and
sustained efforts to advance the fossil fuel subsidy reform agenda in multilateral fora including
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
39. Taking action to ensure New Zealand has access to liquid fossil fuels, including in scenarios
where international borders are severely disrupted, may support a smooth and managed
transition especially where the Government is also taking action to incentivise the
development of renewables. Any action to support the continuation of fossil fuel refining
should have a clear end-point and be recognised as a short to medium-term measure within in
the longer term transition to renewables.    


Loan facility or subsidy to keep the refinery operating for up to 10 years
42. Some commentators, including First Union representing affected workers, have called for the
Government to support Refining NZ financially to keep the refinery open for a period of time –
until refining becomes profitable again and/or until New Zealand has alternative transport fuels
and is less dependent on imported fossil fuels. In principle, a loan facility could provide for
Refining NZ to draw down when refining margins are below some threshold, could limit the
amount of drawdown in any year, and could require repayment when refining margins exceed
some threshold.
43. Refining NZ has not, to date, sought or proposed financial assistance to keep the refinery
operating, but it may be open to any such discussions before making a final commitment to
the conversion (i.e. before 30 September 2021).
44. Officials have advised me that that there does not appear to be a clear case for maintaining
refinery operations for fuel resilience reasons, except to address an exceptional ‘no fuel
imports’ scenario. This is an unlikely scenario, but not entirely implausible, therefore I believe
the option of maintaining refinery capacity warrants an active decision by the Government.
45. First Union and others suggest an annual subsidy or loan equivalent to about one cent per
litre on ground fuels sold ($70–100 million per annum) could be sufficient, over the next few
years, for Refining NZ to achieve its desired level and stability of earnings. This would be the
cost of insurance against the closed border risk described above, and enable longer transition
planning for affected staff. If and when refining margins recover after 2024, as is forecast by
Refining NZ and independent advisers, then any financial support from Government could
potentially be repaid over subsequent years. 
=> WHY NOT JUST TARIFF REFINED IMPORTS

Australia’s recent fuel security package
46. The subsidy option is broadly comparable with part of the Australian Government’s recent fuel
security package, which will keep open the two remaining oil refineries in Australia until 2027
with the option to extend to 2030. Under Australia’s subsidy scheme, refiners only receive
support in downtimes, not when they are profitable.
47. The Australian Government’s support for domestic refining appears to be motivated by
national security and ‘sovereign capability’ considerations.
48. It is also notable that Australia’s refining sector and related industry is significantly larger than New Zealand’s. Australia had seven operating refineries in 2010. By December 2020, its
remaining four refineries had announced plans to close or review their future viability. Two
refineries confirmed their closure and in May 2021 the Australian Government agreed to pay
up to A$2.3 billion to keep the last two refineries open.
49. The two supported Australian refineries have a combined capacity approximately equal to
Australia’s domestic crude production, but a relatively small proportion of Australia’s total fuel
demand. It is therefore unlikely that New Zealand could be supplied from Australian refineries
during a ‘closed border’ event in which both Australia and New Zealand are unable to import
refined fuels. 


Summary of impacts
61. Closure of the Marsden Point refinery will result in:
a. Loss of about 240 direct jobs and associated economic impact in Northland
b. Loss of corporate and income tax revenue (unquantified)
c. Increased cost of IEA 90-day stockholding compliance – up to $13 million annually
d. Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of between 0.75 and 1.2 Mt CO2-e annually.
62. Should the closure warrant a future decision to increase domestic fuel stock levels, to mitigate
the impact of a major fuel import disruption, indicative costs could be up to
Next steps

Next steps
63. I consider that the reduction in fuel supply resilience presented by loss of domestic refining
warrants careful consideration by the Government.
64. In the medium term, the next 10 to 15 years, New Zealand’s dependence of imported fossil
fuels could be reduced through measures to accelerate the large-scale production of domestic
biofuels (e.g. drop-in biodiesel and SAF) and the uptake of electric vehicles, especially for
essential services like food distribution.

65. In the nearer term, the next five or 10 years, fuel import supply resilience could be improved
by ensuring minimum levels of fuel stocks are held in New Zealand, especially diesel which is
critical for maintaining essential services.
66. I consider there may be a case to increase the level of fuel stocks held in New Zealand, as a
buffer against the risk of a significant global supply disruption. I propose to consult on options
to increase domestic stock levels (i.e. what level of stock to hold) and options to ensure the
desired fuel stock levels are maintained (whether by Government procurement or by way of a
minimum stockholding obligation).
67. There may also be options to retain refining capacity in the short term. If Cabinet considers
there is merit in exploring ways to retain refining operations for a period of time, the next step
would be to open discussions with Refining NZ on potential loan or subsidy options. Subject to
Cabinet approval and sufficient funding, a negotiating team with legal and commercial
advisory roles could be established. If a satisfactory agreement were to be negotiated, I would
return to Cabinet for approval.

why didn't you investigate the option of a tariff ?






I propose to progress development of options to ensure
domestic fuel stock levels remain adequate, as a means of supporting fuel supply resilience,
as New Zealand transitions away from fossil fuels. 

`implications for meeting the Government’s first emissions reduction budget.`

The Minister of Energy and Resources recommends that the Committee:

1. Note that Refining NZ plans to convert its Marsden Point oil refinery to a fuel import terminal and
expects to make a final decision by 30 September 2021.
2. Note that closure of the refinery is expected to have little impact on fuel supply resilience under
most disruption scenarios, but it could reduce New Zealand’s resilience to a low likelihood but
high consequence event that leaves New Zealand with no ability to import fuels.
3. Note that options to mitigate any reduction in fuel resilience include increasing minimum levels
of fuel stock held in New Zealand and/or subsidising Refining NZ to maintain refinery operations
for a limited period.
4. Note that there is not a strong case on the basis of fuel security to maintain refinery operations
but there are broader considerations.
5. Agree to investigate the option of increasing minimum levels of fuel stock held in New Zealand.
6. Invite the Minister of Energy and Resources to report back to Cabinet by 20 December 2021 for
approval to release a consultation paper on minimum fuel stockholding obligations.

  - Highly skilled jobs and manufacturing capability 
        - RNZ currently employs around 400 people directly, a similar number indirectly
        - Less demand for the current New Zealand coastal shipping fleet
        - RNZ contributes about \$10 million to the largely fixed cost of supplying electricity, water and other utilities
        - RNZ employs about 120 skilled engineers with specialist expertise in energy whose skills may not have alternate sources of employment in New Zealand.
        - Mothballing would need several years to re-start. Demolition and site rremeidation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
    - Transition to future domestic hydrogen and liquid biofuels industries 

As MBIE pushed ahead with apthe decision not to act to preven the Marsden Point Refinery closure, they commissioined the report [Refining NZ: Impact of conversion to fuels terminal](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/15260-refining-nz-impact-of-conversion-to-fuels-terminal). 

commisioned by MBIE - and subsequently ignored, made the following points about the impact of a move to an import only model:
- A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely 
 to impact New Zealand's supply security
- An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks
covering at least 90 days of New Zealand's daily net import requirement;
- The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that 
 (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast)
- No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification 
  which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions
- Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP;
- No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2;
- Loss of technical processing expertise;
- Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).
