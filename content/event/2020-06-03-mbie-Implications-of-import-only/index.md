    - Highly skilled jobs and manufacturing capability 
        - RNZ currently employs around 400 people directly, a similar number indirectly
        - Less demand for the current New Zealand coastal shipping fleet
        - RNZ contributes about \$10 million to the largely fixed cost of supplying electricity, water and other utilities
        - RNZ employs about 120 skilled engineers with specialist expertise in energy whose skills may not have alternate sources of employment in New Zealand.
        - Mothballing would need several years to re-start. Demolition and site rremeidation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
    - Transition to future domestic hydrogen and liquid biofuels industries
