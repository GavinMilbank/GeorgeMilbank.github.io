# Portela Technology

We build cloud based, containerized, full stack solutions, from ETL pipelines to front end applications for any type of business. We have deep experience in many verticals including healthcare, derivatives pricing and risk management, billing systems, payment systems, data mining and machine learning.

We built an FHIR database, data migration tool, API and developer portal 
which enabled Healthpoint to unlock the value of their database to the
healthcare application developer community.

We want to help you bring your existing data or bright new idea to a
state of unmatched data-driven greatness.

`$${\sqrt {n}}\left(\left({\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\right)-\mu \right)\ {\xrightarrow {d}}\ N\left(0,\sigma ^{2}\right)$$`
