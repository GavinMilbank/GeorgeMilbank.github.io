      <description>FHIR concerns itself principally with recording healthcare system events and less about modeling. Every event recorded by a FHIR system may be modeled to predict its future behavior, and the estimates of the modeled distribution parameters conveniently stored in the FHIR schema. It does not appear to be prescribed or suggested how to to this.
One idea is to abstract away the modeled quantity e.g. duration in an FHIR Task and replace this by the parameters of the distribution of task time (mean and standard deviation if Gaussian), and store these instead of the realized instance.</description>
