      <description>User Guide  Units Expressions - up to lambda functions and higher order functions Simulation Object - The Simulation object is used to store inputs that define basic parameters of the model, such as run duration. The Simulation object is created automatically when a new model is started, and thus does not appear in the Model Builder. Configuration File API - JaamSimModel programmatic method of controlling simulation Maintenance, Breakdowns, and Thresholds - model planned maintenance, breakdowns, and process blockages - Reliability, - Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) analysis  Thresholds - TimeSeries, Expression, Signal Downtime - random or scheuduled events based on wworking or calendar time States - (working|idle|stopped|maintenance|breakdown)   Probability Distributions - generative  DrawValue, NumOfSamples, (theorteical|calculated) mean and stddev,    14.</description>

      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>

      <description>2. Overview of Supervised Learning 2.3 Prediction Least Squares to Nearest Neighbors 2.3.1 Linear Models and Least Squares  N factors = N dim linear model = N+1 coefficient if bias included. invert : min(Norm(predictions(sample)-outcomes),coefficients)   2.3.2 Nearest-Neighbor Methods  simple average of nearest K (e.g.Â euclidean norm) 1-NN =&amp;gt; voronoi tesselation   2.3.3 From Least Squares to Nearest Neighbors  LLS == low variance high bias - best for linear real models kNN == high variance low bias - fits any real model kNN and linear regression have biggest market share.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction  lineage - Pascal, Fermat, Bernoulli, De Moivre, Euler, Gauss, Laplace, Kolmologorov, Borel, Lebesgue, Levy. chapter 2-12 probability (integration) on discrete, countable then general mesaure spaces. chapter 13-21 limit theorems, Gaussian distributions, transformations chapter 22,23 conditional expecation as Hilbert Space projection chapter 24-28 martingales and Radon-Nokidym theorem - not really essentials but god for stochastic processes.   2. Axioms  Let \(\Omega\) be an abstract event space with no special structure.</description>
