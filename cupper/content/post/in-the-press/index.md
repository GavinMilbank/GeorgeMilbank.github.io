    - > The Energy Minister said these risks are not significant, but a consultant's report to the government says the opposite.

    - > Security and resilience were now the two most important factors for the economy. The closure of the refinery was corporate self-interest and not in the wider interests of New Zealand. It was disturbing that the lessons from Covid and the flow on disruption to our supply chains were being ignored.
- [Aug 2021 - Government defends import-only strategy](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/448612/marsden-point-potential-closure-government-defends-import-only-strategy)
    - The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) said that "would mark a significant change in New Zealand's fuel supply chain".
    - But its advice was that the supply chain was secure because the country could get fuel from multiple locations overseas.
    - It was "very unlikely" the country would ever be cut off entirely, and if it were, this would cut shipping of crude oil, too, the ministry told RNZ.

    - > This was New Zealand’s only refinery. It seems an unnecessarily risky move from the Government to let it close without exploring other options
- [Sep 2021 - MBIE Fuel Supply Resilience without a domestic refinery](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/17733-fuel-supply-resilience-without-a-domestic-oil-refinery-proactiverelease-pdf)
    - > There does not appear to be a clear case for maintaining refinery operations for fuel resilience reasons, except to address an exceptional ‘no fuel imports’ scenario. This is an unlikely scenario, but not entirely implausible, therefore I believe the option of maintaining refinery capacity warrants an active decision by Government.
    - > I have considered an option to support Refining NZ to ensure the refinery continues operating
for a period of time – perhaps five or 10 years – by limiting its exposure to volatile earnings.
The Government could provide a loan or similar underwrite facility to support Refining NZ
through the current period of low earnings (expected to persist for two to three years), with
reasonable prospect of repayment if or when refining earnings return to adequate levels.
    - > I do not believe there is a strong case to support continued refinery operations on fuel security grounds but I acknowledge there are broader considerations. I am therefore open to
commencing discussions with Refining NZ on that option, should Cabinet invite me to do so,
subject to availability of budget for a negotiating team with the necessary commercial and
legal capability (up to \$1 million).
    - > I also consider the other adverse impacts of the planned closure are manageable and do not warrant measures that would, among other things, make it harder for us to meet the first emissions reduction budget
    - >  However, while the likelihood of a major fuel import disruption is small in the next 10-15 years, I acknowledge the consequences of such an event would be serious and this risk warrants
careful consideration. On this basis, I am open to alternative views on the merits of
commencing discussions with Refining NZ on options to ensure continued operation for five to
10 years.
