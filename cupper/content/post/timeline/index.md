We detail some of the main events in the loss of our refinery, with the help of documents obtained by an [OIA request](https://fyi.org.nz/request/15722-copies-of-consultants-reports-and-communications-between-mbie-and-stakeholders-related-to-the-potential-closure-of-marsden-point-oil-refinery).

- [2019-12-19 **MBIE discussion paper - Accelerating renewable energy**](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/discussion-document-accelerating-renewable-energy-and-energy-efficiency.pdf)
    - According to Megan Woods (ideological and unproven):
        > The coming years will see a complete re-wiring of global energy systems
        in response to the threat of climate change, and the economic and
        environmental opportunities low emissions energy sources are creating

    - RNZ reminds the government
        - RNZ refines imported crude intp 70% of NZ's transport fuel need.
        - Import of refined products equates to an export of GDP.
        - The refinery is a platform for the production of low emission fuels.
- [2020-04-15 **Indpendent Report for MBIE - Impact of Conversion to Fuels Terminal**](/assets/refining-nz-impact-of-conversion-to-fuels-terminal.pdf)
    - The change of the Marsden Point facility to a fuels terminal would have a significant impact of New Zealand's fuel security   including:
        - A reduction in physical inventories (expected to be 25-30%) that ultimately is likely to impact New Zealand's supply security;
        - An increased cost of compliance to meet the IEA membership requirement to hold stocks covering at least 90 days of New Zealand's daily net import requirement;
        - The loss of the coastal tanker operation and the expertise associated with that (albeit import tankers would increase so there would still be plenty of ships on the coast);
        - No ability in New Zealand to correct product that is significantly off-specification which needs to be taken into account with stock level decisions;
        - Possible issues with jet import availability if it all needs to meet a lower sulphur specification for transport via RAP;
        - No local supply of sulphur for fertiliser; replacement supply needed for CO2;
        - Loss of technical processing expertise; and
        - Loss of ability to process New Zealand crude in a major supply emergency (global meltdown
or pandemic where New Zealand might be isolated for a time).
- [2020-04-15 **RNZ Announces Strategic Review at start of Covid**](https://www.nzx.com/announcements/351663)
    - low refining margins globally and oversupply in the Asia region.
    - capital structure to maximise value for shareholders.

    - security of fuel supply for New Zealand 
    - importance of refining capability and optionality for fuel supply
    - the contribution of RNZ to the Northland economy
    - the role of RNZ’s skills and assets in a transition to lower carbon fuels
- [2020-04-30 **RNZ strategic Review**](/assets/RNZ-Strategic-Review.pdf)
    - strategic review options
        - Continue current refinery model
        - Alter refinery operating model
        - Separate refining and infrastructure assets
        - Convert to an import terminal        
- [2020-06-03 **MBIE - Implications of replacing refinery with import terminal**](oia/Doc%202%203319%2019-20%20Briefing%20-%20Update%20on%20Refining%20NZ%20strategic%20review_Redacted.pdf)
    - Highly skilled jobs and manufacturing capability 
        - RNZ currently employs around 400 people directly, a similar number indirectly
        - Less demand for the current New Zealand coastal shipping fleet
        - RNZ contributes about \$10 million to the largely fixed cost of supplying electricity, water and other utilities
        - RNZ employs about 120 skilled engineers with specialist expertise in energy whose skills may not have alternate sources of employment in New Zealand.
        - Mothballing would need several years to re-start. Demolition and site rremeidation would cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
    - Transition to future domestic hydrogen and liquid biofuels industries

    - very interesting

    - Simplify operations

    1. Strategic importance of maintaining refining capacity in New Zealand.
    2. Impact of change to import model on NZ's IEA oil stock obligation.
    3. Changes in government policy for fuel supply chain resilience.
    4. Options for RNZ to access cheaper electricity and gas.
    5. Longer term EITE allocations under the ETS
    6. How RNZ’s assets and people may help with low carbon transition.

    1. Strategic importance was acknowledged, but not the risks.
    2. IEA obligation - extra storage costs probably passed onto the consumer.
    3. Control of fuel infrastructure - proobably not going to happen.
    4. Electricity and gas - speak to the suppliers
    5. Industrial allocatioon under ETS - a risk for RNZ  
    6. Transition to low carbon - Government could not incorpoarte the refinery into their low-carrbon plans.

    - RNZ madee the decision to close the refinery in 2020 the most challenging in its 60 year history
        - Why wasn't it supporrted like other businesses ?
        - Thie year would have been the most profitable
    - RNZ also owns and operates the Refinery-Auckland Pipeline (RAP).
    - Government only seemed interested in import terminal and 
    - Import only results in big reduction in stock - The Hale and Twomey reports outlines the dangers.
    - NZs rservers are held in tickets.
    - RNZ advised durring phase 1 that closing the refinery would not reduce NZ fuel security 
      given the "diversity and robustness of product import supplu chains"
