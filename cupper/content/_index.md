Marsden Point Refinery is a critical piece of infrastructure providing:

- 40% of the country’s total energy needs
- 70% of the country’s transport fuel needs
- 70% of the country’s roading bitumen
- 100% of Auckland Airport’s jet fuel

The decision to  destroy the refinery and move to an import only model: 

- Exposes us to global supply shock, price and quality risks.
- Removes an option of development of our [domestic energy resources]().
- Removes an option to for [recycle our waste biomass]().

This was taken under the cover of the Covid pandemic, ignoring the warnings of an 
[independent report on the risks of moving to a North Asian import only model](), by these parties: 

- [Shareholders (The Fuel Retailing Cartel)]()
- [Refining NZ Management]()
- [Government green ideologues]()

The foolishness of this move was immediately shown by [geopolitcal events]().

It's not too late to [secure the refinery](https://www.securemarsdenrefinery.nz/).

- The government could yet intervene as has for other critical public goods such as [Kiwirail](https://www.kiwirail.co.nz/our-story/history/), [Air New Zealand]() and [Tiwai Point]() and [Ihumatao](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/433043/ihumatao-deal-struck-between-government-and-fletcher-building-to-buy-disputed-land)
- Government intervention was discuseed in a [Megan Woods cabinet paper](), but willfully ignored.
- We could encourage different ownership structures nwith the type of planning horizon necessary for such a crucial asset.
