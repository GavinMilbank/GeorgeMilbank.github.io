title: "Why Save Marsden Point ?"
---

We are a small isolated country and we can't afford to get the decision wrong.  
Marsden Point Refinery can be saved. Until 2021 it provided:

- 40% of the total energy needs of New Zealand
- 70% of the country’s transport fuel needs
- 100% of Auckland Airport’s jet fuel
- 70% of the roading bitumen

With its demolition, New Zealand's energy security has been sacrificed by:

- Shareholders pursuing short term profits
- Government green ideologues

The government snd the shareholders used the circumstnaces of Covid to 
justify closing the refinery, ignoring the warnings of the independent report
on the risks of moving to an import only model which:

- Exposes us to global supply shock, price and quality risks.
- Comes at a time when refining margins are at record highs. 
- Removes an option of development of our domestic energy resources.
- Harms the envirronment by removing an option to recycle our waste biomass.

The foolishness of this move was almost immediately demonstrated by a geoploitcal events,
During Covid, the government saved every inductry apart form refining. The government could yet 
step in or influence too prrevent the destruction:

- As was discussed in a [Megan Woods cabinet paper](), but rejected.
- As it did for [Kiwirail](https://www.kiwirail.co.nz/our-story/history/), [Air New Zealand]() and [Tiwai Point]() and [Ihumatao](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/433043/ihumatao-deal-struck-between-government-and-fletcher-building-to-buy-disputed-land)
